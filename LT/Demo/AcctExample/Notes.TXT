* GrVectMap sucks
* return vals for grrect, grblot, grputchar?
* collisions for grrect, grblot, grputchar?

* 32-bit devices should be in free spot address space of E820.

* Might want VMWare Install
* RAM drive too small for LTFull.ISO

* Logrep throw for out-of-mem?
* {Lock|Rep}{Seg|2E=NotBr|3E=Br}{OP}{ADD}{REX}
* Virtual Box MP reboot
* Std local var names
* EIE_ABS_ADDR 64

GrEdit: Move sidebar selected elems.
	- Be careful of multipoint elems.
GrEdit: Strip origin shift cmds.

GrEditBitmap, grabscroll? 
GrEditBitmap, cut/paste boxes.

* Might make TS/TAD sub account.

extern of fun with dft arg of str?

* We kinda need a routine to return how much free memory, so that
applications 
can plan a big alloc.

* FileMgr bad with lots of files.  

* This [::/LT/OSMain/TaskCmd.CPZ,Fs->catch_except=TRUE] Fs->catch_except=TRUE
causes problems because it catches divide and 
out-of-mem.  Not sure what to do, yet.
* [C:/LT/OSMain/MultiProc.CPZ,413] MPStart() free old task memory. (Prolly
never gonna do anything about this.)
* [C:/LT/OSMain/Adam1b.HPZ,128] sys_var_init_flag local vars.
* sprite shift points, ctrl pt for ellipse/polygon w,h is off when rotated.

* Window manager needs to do LTF operations on posted messages from mouse.  
Works for [C:/LT/OSMain/KbdMouse/InputPointer.CPZ,74] SetIP(), though.

* Add local vars to sym table in [C:/LT/OSMain/Dbg1a.CPZ,431] Dbg()?  (maybe)

This shit: 



* Who's ever reading this -- [Proverbs,30:10] Proverbs,30:10

* [::/LT/Adam/Ltf/LtfRecalc.APZ,->tag+i] Bible sized nodes
* Mouseinstall throws exceptions, doesn't work, investigate Mouse
[::/LT/OSMain/KbdMouse/Mouse.CPZ,9FC] 0x9FC30, get 
kbd lights working.
* figure-out hyperthread vs nonhyperthread CPU's
* Might have issue with compiler exceptions and restoring lex.hash tables.
* Generates two compiler error messages for expressions in statements.
* release semaphores or break lock sema,usb_td
* Fix Mom's secondary CD-ROM, dad's primary
* pmtstr in install didn't like focus change

*U0 Main()
{
  U0 (*fp_old_draw_input_ptr)(GrDC *dc,I64 x,I64 y)=fp_draw_input_ptr;
}

* Disk write caching is broken. Deadlock.

* Syncronize VGA memory update with the hardware refresh cycle.

* Demo [C:/LT/OSMain/Adam1a.HPZ,3773] TaskKeyDevStruct
* Demo [C:/LT/Adam/ToHtml.APZ,250] ToHtml().

* Del short name in FAT32--currently I do not check to see if I have
generated 
a unique short name and one can delete multiple files accidentally.  
Generating unique short names is a pain in the ass because you have to scan 
the whole directory.  I think I just truncate the name instead of "Program~1" 
or whatever. S081130-0001.BMP crashed windows--two identical short names.

* OVERSTRIKE at cmd line with menu macro.

* lock{} warning on invalid modes.
* Local array vars-->reg.
* [C:/LT/OSMain/Adam1a.HPZ,3448] DCF_SYMMETRY, before transformation?
(Currently it's after) 
* all graphics clipping -- screen y+top<0 for top<0
* Maybe convert graphics to float
* compiler F32
* preempt(OFF) during graphic clipping?
* compiler optimization heap_glbls with added offset
* static_compile extern glblvar referrences. 
* extern glbl var in static module on data heap.
* Might make FAT32 read in contiguous chunks.
* make Limit(),Min(),Max() asm routines.
* Might make GrSprite flood fill operate on a separate bitmap and blotted at 
the end.
* autofile popup of popup
* <CTRL-R> delete subsprite in menu near others
* consider changing domenu so a real <ESC> on menu item doesn't select
(<SPACE 
BAR> sends <ESC> followed by <SPACE BAR> or something)
* puts3 with depth buf?  might not do this
* make task insque and remque safe for multicore cycling through tasks (fwd).
* make better heapwalk, do something with _CFG_HEAP_DBG.
* log to file--would be inefficient--load-in whole file, modify and write
out. 
 Useful, but not very efficient  (LoseThos file system has no grow-file 
ability.  Created when FAT patent was an issue and wanted absly nothing
people 
could sue me for.)
* APIC2
* import intel datasheets, somehow?
* Might make DskView show drive colors.
* Might do utility to set drive colors, making a tree entry in Adam 3 using 
registry-like routines... or registry I guess.

* New Editor widgets

* Make use of flag potential in SysFilesFind and possibly LTFileAccess
* implement fixed pos files

* new C+ language feats
* better debugging

* Change hardcoded stuff to Define
* Too much preemption turned off?
* Look for mem leaks.
* Move stuff out of OSmain.

* use width and height in line clipping for pen_width>1 or blot.
* SIMD transformation
* test removable media id  (critical for resident files)

* add field overflow U8 "t='*'"
* Implement fmt codes into GetF
* GetF date codes and maybe h fmts for nums
* Date Input
* Default date fmt

* 16 bit Unassembly is bad--very low priority
* more signed int disassembly
* support r4u8 by adding 0x40 byte
* static var off of data heap.
* Might want to use U32*U32 multiplication.
* could add "const" to not set LF_NOT_CONSTANT flag for trig, etc.
* do r,rm IcCmp like IcBrCmp
* could make glblvar imports use TY_RIP_DISP32.
* PUSH_CMP allocs reg R9 or whatever
* Might be problem with NOP in OPT pass1 for NO_PUSH in expressions besides 
assignments.  Is ShiftNoPush fully implemented?
* NOP1 might need to have diff ic_data's
* in divequal, it assumes about ebx
* error/warning line nums
* ASM branch out warning of range off by 1 line--use lx->last_line_num
* Autoindent:do-while/while: [::/LT/Demo/Maze.CPZ] ::/LT/Demo/Maze.CPZ

* Switch statement with sparse cases (low priority)
* maybe inline functions?
* Use of more floating-point stk?

* More aggressive in this routine [C:/LT/Compiler/OptPass3.CPZ,29]
CmpF2PushPop() with types besides MOV and 
F64. 
* !dbl ~dbl
* &=, |= can overflow with Bts Btr on small data types

* num lock comes on with break key
* sort options for findfiles
* recalc_start could be more accurate before recalculating?

The pattern for Major Geeks/BetaNews is too regular.  And, I added all those 
shareware sites and no affect on downloads. And, I only get FBI emails--not 
one install.
