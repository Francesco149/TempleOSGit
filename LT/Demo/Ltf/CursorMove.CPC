//The word-wrap Off and On cmds are
//$WW,0$ and $WW,1$.

//You might need [C:/LT/Adam/Ltf/LtfNew.APZ,668] LtfMax() to adjust
//the cmd line window buf size.
//It counts cmds, not lines.

//The +H flag will hold-onto an entry
//so it doesn't get pushed-out of the document.
//This is useful for a $WW+H,1$ cmd.

//See [::/LT/Doc/Dollar.TXZ] ::/LT/Doc/Dollar.TXZ for documentation on
//all flags and cmds.


//Note: the default page length is 66 lines
//and branching back more than the page length
//will rst the column to 1.  So, set page
//length to a large number if you want to
//branch back a long distance.
