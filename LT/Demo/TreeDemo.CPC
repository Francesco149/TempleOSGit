/*
This uses LtfPutSExt/LtfPrintF because updates
to within a tree while a tree is collapsed get
messed-up if "live"(like using ordinary PrintF/PutS.)
The insert point is confused by hiding of
data in collapsed trees.  Therefore, the window main
Ltf is taken off-line by disabling preemption so there
are no screen updates until all data has been inserted.

There is a special Ltf function which is also
available to take an Ltf off-line.  See [C:/LT/Adam/Ltf/LtfRecalc.APZ,1680] LtfSafeInsert.
For this example, however, I wanted to use LtfPrintF
and disabled Preemption myself.
