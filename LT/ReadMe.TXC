                    The LoseThos Operating System

You can't do much until you burn a LoseThos CD-ROM from the ISO file
and boot it.  The files are compressed and the source code can only be 
compiled by the LoseThos compiler... which is available when you boot
the CD-ROM.  LoseThos is 100% open source with all source present, even
on the standard distribution.

LoseThos is 64-bit and will not run on 32-bit hardware.

LoseThos may require you to enter I/O port addresses for the CD-ROM drive
and the hard drive.  In Windows, you can find I/O port info in the
Accessories folder, System Tools, System Info, Hardware Resources, 
I/O ports.  Look for and write down "IDE", "ATA" or "SATA" port numbers.
Then, boot the LoseThos CD and try all combinations.  (Sorry, it's too
difficult for LoseThos to figure-out port numbers automatically.)

The source code can also be found at the LoseThos web site, 
http://www.losethos.com but cannot be compiled outside LoseThos because
it's a nonstandard language, a variation of C/C++ and asm.  If you really
want the source code uncompressed and can't boot, send an email to 
tdavis@losethos.com requesting the full version.  It's free.  The full 
version includes LTZ, a uncompress tool for Linux and Windows.

To get the full version, send an email to tdavis@losethos.com requesting
the full version.  You just have to explain what hardware you have and
tell what works or doesn't work.
