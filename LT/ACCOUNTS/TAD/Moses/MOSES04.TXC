          I decided to wear this hat to remind
          me to stay humble before you. I also
          have a bald spot and I figure if everyone
          wears one, nobody will notice.
          Pretty clever, huh?     


                                              Why don't you write that
                                              down and sexcept it to your
                                              forehead to help you remember.

  BRABANTIO. So let the Turk of Cyprus us beguile;
    We lose it not so long as we can smile.
    He bears the sentence well, that nothing bears
    But the free comfort which from thence he hears;
    But he bears both the sentence and the sorrow
    That, to pay grief, must of poor patience borrow.
    These sentences, to sugar or to gall,
    Being strong on both sides, are equivocal.
    But words are words; I never yet did hear
    That the bruised heart was pierced through the ear.
    I humbly beseech you, proceed to the affairs of state.

    Othello, the fortitude of the place is best known to you; and
    though we have there a substitute of most allowed
sufficiency,
    yet opinion, a sovereign mistress of effects, throws a more

Poor people who can't boot are in grief?... something about smiling... maybe 
I'm supposed to talk politics (state)  humilty and earrings kinda tie in, but 
I don't see the big picture yet.  I'll have to meditate more.  I have a 
glossary feature to explain how I interpret various words.  Wordstat even has 
a feature where it prints a '#' when it is hovering on a term with a glossary 
entry.

I have meditated.  First, I realize I have to be careful not to cover the 
short comings of my operating system the way the bald guy wore a hat.  That 
was inspired.  Second, my operating system works better on simple hardware, 
not supporting wireless keyboards or large hard drives, for example.  The
part 
about bootless grief might have to do with some kind of justice along this 
line, or might be just a promise of things to come.  Third, I have to be 
careful of being like Othello, a noble character led astray by Iago, an evil 
guy.  

I've detected a campaign to oppose me where high resolution images and stuff 
are saturating the media.  Whatever... I'll just do what I can.  I'm
convinced 
eye-candy is being marketed in place of substance.  I detected hostility from 
an Indian(Asian) and, for no particular reason, I drew Moses sitting Indian 
style and God mentioned big_endians.

The rhyming reminds me of a fancy gibberish program I wrote using the
WordStat 
matrices which runs under Windows.  It's fools-gold, compared to God-inspired 
gibberish.  The Indian was discussing data-mining.  As you can see, it'd be 
hard to beat God!

They just played "duality" by Slip Knot.  I guess it's blasphemeous--the line 
about "future seems like one big past" makes me think someone is anticipating 
justice for their past behavior. I get delusional(spiritual) feedback in the 
media, so events in the world often seem to have duality, in that they are 
real events, but also significant to me for other reasons. It can drive you 
crazy and frequently punishment comes through this. 

Maybe, I only explained half (50%)?  I'm not sure how much is obvious to most 
people.  To my credit, it was fitting that God suggest the forehead thing 
after Moses had been vain (the forehead scripture box doesn't look so cool.)
