One jiffy is one time slice.  [Jiffies] Jiffies returns time slices since
boot and takes 
longer to compute than [C:/LT/OSMain/Adam1b.HPZ,206] GetTimeStamp.

[ReadSysTimer] ReadSysTimer reads the timer ticks since boot.  It's not as
fast as 
[C:/LT/OSMain/Adam1b.HPZ,206] GetTimeStamp.

Use [C:/LT/OSMain/Adam1a.HPZ,454] JIFFY_FREQ to convert [Jiffies] Jiffies.

Use [C:/LT/OSMain/Adam1a.HPZ,456] SYS_TIMER_FREQ to convert [ReadSysTimer]
ReadSysTimer.
