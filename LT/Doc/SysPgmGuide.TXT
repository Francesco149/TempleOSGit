* See [::/LT/Doc/Glossary.TXZ,Naming convention] Naming convention.

* I avoid the '?' operator.  It's not very efficient with my compiler since
it 
executes both expressions and I just don't like it.

* I place "New", "Del", "Init", "Rst", ect. on the end of a function name 
instead of beginning.  "RstMusicSettings" should be "MusicSettingsRst".

* I often use 64-bit values in function args when smaller would be more 
appropriate because the compiler generally is more efficient with 64-bit 
values.  (All value get promoted to 64-bit by the LoseThos compiler, when 
fetched.)  I return a BoolI64 from functions instead of BoolI8.

* Short circuit logic is assumed.

* I generally avoid boolean expression assignments because TRUE is dangerous 
with different compilers, though, the LoseThos compiler should use 1 for TRUE 
values, not just nonzero.  Boolean assignments don't have short circuit logic 
and are not compiled efficiently.  The BoolI8 type is just an alias for a 1 
byte int -- nothing forces it to 1 or 0.  There is a
[C:/LT/OSMain/Adam1b.HPZ,211] ToBool() function.

* If you use floats in your interrupt routine, save and restore the fpu state 
with [C:/LT/OSMain/Adam1b.HPZ,250] Fxsave() and [C:/LT/OSMain/Adam1b.HPZ,251]
Fxrstor().  The timer interrupt does this.  The keyboard and 
mouse don't use floats.

* Bracketing code with PushFD;Cli; and PopFD; will protect against 
simultaneous accesses from tasks on _one_ core.  To protect against multiple 
cores, you need a locked semaphore.

* I don't use TYPEDEFs, for no particular reason.

* [C:/LT/OSMain/Misc1a.CPZ,305] SysDbg() and [C:/LT/OSMain/Misc1a.CPZ,311]
IsSysDbg() are really handy when working on the compiler or 
OSMain.  It's just a bit you can set and test.
