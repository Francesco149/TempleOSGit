A Queue is a bunch of [C:/LT/OSMain/Memory.CPZ,925] MAlloc()ed chunks of
memory linked together in a circle 
with one pointer to the next value and another pointer to the last value.  
These pointers must be stored in the first locations in the structure.  
Typically, you have a special head of the queue which is special and marks
the 
start.
