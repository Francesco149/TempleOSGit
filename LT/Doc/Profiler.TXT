The LoseThos profiler records statistics on what code location was executing 
when a task was preempted.  You can learn where most time is wasted.  There 
are two modes, [C:/LT/Adam/Profiler.APZ,45] ProfBin() which monitors a range
of buckets and [C:/LT/Adam/Profiler.APZ,80] ProfAll() which 
records a hit location as well as count.  I recommend
[C:/LT/Adam/Profiler.APZ,80] ProfAll().

You can pass a subroutine depth level argument which records a hit in not
only 
the routine executing, but the routines which called it, as well.

When done collecting statistics, use [C:/LT/Adam/Profiler.APZ,106] ProfRep()
for a report.  You might need a 
[C:/LT/Adam/Ltf/LtfNew.APZ,672] LtfMax() to expand the command line window
buffer to fit it all.

You can set the CPU to monitor with [C:/LT/Adam/Profiler.APZ,66] ProfCPUSet().

Study the code.  The profiler is very simple and you might want to enhance it 
or modify it to debug something in particular.
