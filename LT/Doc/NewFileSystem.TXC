                           Adding a New File System

If you want to add a support for a new file system, do a text search on 
"PT_FAT32".  All the places where that occurs will require new entries for 
your file system type.  Click here for search.
`Grep("PT_FAT32","/LT/" SRC_FILE_MASK);View;`


You will also need to add an entry [::/LT/OSMain/Define1a.CPZ,ST_PRT_TYPES]
here.
