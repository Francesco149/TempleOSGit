LoseThos uses a 64-bit value, [C:/LT/OSMain/Adam1a.HPZ,205] LTDate, for
date/time.  The upper 32-bits are 
the days since Christ.  The lower 32-bits store time of day divided by 4 
billion which works out to 49710ths of a second.  You can subtract two
[C:/LT/OSMain/Adam1a.HPZ,205] LTDate'
s to get a time span.

Use [C:/LT/OSMain/Adam1a.HPZ,490] LTDATE_FREQ to convert.
