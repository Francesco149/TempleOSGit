"Input Ptr" is the mouse at this point.

[C:/LT/OSMain/OSGlbls.CPZ,70] ipx and [C:/LT/OSMain/OSGlbls.CPZ,70] ipy can
be used to access the x and y coordinates of the input ptr.  
They are relative to the screen, not window.  These can be used if you don't 
want to use msg passing.  [C:/LT/OSMain/OSGlbls.CPZ,70] ipz is the wheel.

[C:/LT/OSMain/OSGlbls.CPZ,76] iptx and [C:/LT/OSMain/OSGlbls.CPZ,77] ipty are
the text column and row of the input ptr.  See 
[::/LT/Demo/Maze.CPZ] ::/LT/Demo/Maze.CPZ.

You can make the input ptr snap to a grid by adjusting Fs->snap.
