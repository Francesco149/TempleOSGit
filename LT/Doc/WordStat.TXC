WordStat collects statistics from all text files in subdirectories when you 
call [C:/LT/Adam/WordStat/WsMain.APZ,651] WsInit().  It counts which words
follow which other words with what 
frequency in a big sparse matrix.

Tip: If you use consistent variable names for items of different classes, 
you'll usually be able to autocomplete the member variables.  I always use lx 
for LexStruct pointers; l for Ltf pointers; ll or cl for LtfEntry pointers, 
etc.
