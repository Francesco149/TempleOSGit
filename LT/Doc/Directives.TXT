The compiler looks-ahead a token most of the time, so you might throw an
extra 
semicolon after the directive if it's not taking affect right away.

#include "" 	There is no angle bracket <> form of this directive.
#exe {}		Will execute code at compile-time and can be used to insert 
code into the stream being compiled using [C:/LT/Compiler/CmpMain.CPZ,14]
StreamPrintF().
#define		Define string constant
#assert		Print a warning during compilation if an expression is not 
true. 
#if		Include code if an expresion is true.
#else
#endif
#ifdef,#ifndef	Include code if a sym is defined.
#ifstatic,#ifnstatic	Include code if in static compiler mode.
defined()	Is a function that can be used in expressions.
#help_index, #help_file See [::/LT/Doc/HelpSystem.TXZ] Help System.

Assembler Directives

See [::/LT/Compiler/OpCodes.TXZ] ::/LT/Compiler/OpCodes.TXZ for
opcodes.  They're not standard.  Some 
invalid instructions are not flagged and some valid instructions are not 
implemented. 16-bit asm support is limited.

Here are example instruction formats:
	ADD	RAX,U64 FS:DISP[RSI+RDI*8]
	ADD	RAX,U64 [DISP]

$ Current compiler output pos (instruction ptr).  Even works in C+ 
expressions.

LABEL::
  Defines an exported glbl label.

LABEL:
  Defines an non-exported glbl label.

@@LABEL:
  Defines a local label with scope valid between two global labels.

DU8, DU16, DU32, DU64
  Define BYTE, WORD, DWORD or QWORD. Can be used with DUP() and ASCII
strings. 
 For your convenience, the ASCII strings do not have terminating
zeros.  DUP() 
can be used with ? for uninitialized values.  Use uninitialized values in 
struc's.  Define cmds must end with a semicolon.

USE16, USE32, USE64

IMPORT sym1name, sym2name;

LIST, NOLIST

ALIGN num, fill_byte
  Align to num boundary and fill with fill_byte.
ALIGN num, ?
  Align to num boundary but do not fill.
