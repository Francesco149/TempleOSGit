                                 Cut Corners

There are a few places where I cut corners in the interest of not junking-up 
code.  This is part of the LoseThos mentality.  I try not to let, often 
stupid, legacy compatibility issues enter and junk-up LoseThos.

* I made my type-casting operator post-fix because it makes the compiler way 
cleaner.

* LoseThos does not figure-out FAT32 short name alias numbers.  
[C:/LT/OSMain/Dsk/FileSysFAT.CPZ,612] FAT32DirEntryNew().  It can cause hard
drive corruption, so I might have to do 
it.  It would really take a lot of junky code for this hatefully, detestable, 
legacy issue.  "Please don't make me ruin my beautiful shiny-new LoseThos
with 
that!"  I am also not enthused about FAT32 because it is in patent limbo.  FAT
32 might get removed from LoseThos.  There is a LoseThos native, 64-bit, file 
system that works perfectly well.  FAT32 is useful, however, because it 
assists in transferring between dual booted operating systems.

* I changed the [::/LT/Compiler/OpCodes.TXZ] asm opcodes names to remove the
ambiguity between instructions 
with different numbers of arguments, making my [::/LT/Compiler/Assembler.CPZ]
assembler simpler and I did 
minimal 16-bit asm support, since 64-bit is what you should be using, unless 
you're doing a [::/LT/Adam/Boot/BootCD.APZ] boot loader.

* There are no file-sharing locks of any kind.  You're on your own.
