LoseThos has a class for 3 dimensional points consisting of F64s.  LoseThos's 
compiler is not C++, so it does not support passing or returning values from 
functions which are not 64-bits, therefore, it can't be implemented with 
operator overloading.  Making all function args and returns 64-bit is a core 
prinicple of LoseThos.

As a courtesy, most of the D3 functions return the addr of the destination 
vect, so you can nestle calls.  They do not allocate new space for the 
destination vect.
