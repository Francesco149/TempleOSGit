Uncomment [HOME/Adam3cSnd.APZ,#include "HDAudio"] #include "HDAudio" in your
/HOME/Adam3cSnd.APZ file to install a 
driver for HD Audio.  Cfgure it with [::/LT/Adam/Snd/HDCfg.CPZ]
::/LT/Adam/Snd/HDCfg.CPZ and add the file 
created, HOME/HDAudioCfg.APZ, to your start-up scripts.  **Comment it out 
everything if you get no snd -- the PC Speaker should still work.**
 
If you don't have HDAudio, you'll have to live with the PC Speaker.  You
might 
write a driver for your snd card following the HDAudio template.
