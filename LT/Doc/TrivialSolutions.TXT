                              Trivial Solutions


The trivial solution in math is the simple, obvious answer.  The fable that 
NASA spent millions on a space pen while Russia used a pencil is another 
example.  LoseThos uses many [::/LT/Doc/Strategy.TXZ] trivial solutions.

History:
I've been working on LoseThos full-time for 15.5 years.  Yes, I wrote every 
one of the 130,933 lines myself, no GPL code, no linkage or dependence on 
other code.  I am a for profit company, not welcoming code contributions, but 
feedback is very welcome.  See [::/LT/Doc/Acknowledgements.TXZ]
::/LT/Doc/Acknowledgements.TXZ.

Technically, I started LoseThos in about 1993, when I wrote a TASM program 
that ran in DOS which switched to protected mode on a 486.  It did little
more 
than read the keyboard and echo to the screen, but was multi-tasking.  I set 
it aside until 2003 when I resurrected it and worked full-time, seriously, on 
it.  I called it Hoppy because it fit on a floppy and my company name at the 
time was H.A.R.E.  I ran Hoppy by launching it from FreeDOS.  A compiler 
(interpreter at the time) was designed into-it from the start, even before a 
file system.  I put the text of files I wanted to compile as raw data in my TA
SM assembled module.  My first crack at a C interpreter was in SimStructure 
(key: A18-W50-U50) and I had done expression evaluators many times, so I was 
not intimidated by writing a compiler.

I renamed it Doors and, then, Davos for a little while; I named it J for a 
year or two; and, finally, settled on LoseThos.  (The name was inspired by
the 
scene in the movie, Platoon, where Elias says to Chris, "S**tcan this and 
this...", referring to dorky standard issue equipment.)

If you're curious, download HOPPY.ZIP (278 KB), J051018.zip (357 KB), or 
LoseThos V1.0 (1.12 Meg).  The FreeDOS trick for launching no longer works 
because the makers of FreeDOS changed it from real mode to v8086 mode,
locking 
it down.

For some time-stamped proof 2004 www.webarchives.org/hare (has download),
2006 www.webarchives.org/justrighteous (no download) or 
2007 YouTube ScreenCast of Songs.  I have weekly Cd-ROM back-ups going way 
back and time-stamped back-up files on source forge going back to
2008.  HOPPY 
runs from any REAL-MODE DOS.  The Visual C project files are just for editing.


LoseThos' Public Domain License:
I don't mind if companies use LoseThos code with or without mentioning it.  
That's why it's public domain and not GPL.  The wider the usage, the better.  
It's kind-of like, "no such thing as bad press."

I don't mind if people use LoseThos code in other operating systems.  The 
casino people here in Vegas say that reservation casinos do not take business 
away, they whet the appetite.  The more people who learn about partitioning 
and booting alternative operating systems, the better.

You'll have to work to walk-off with LoseThos code :-)  I didn't do that on 
purpose, but I'm not going out-of-my-way to make it easy.


Business Plan:
I hope to make money with LoseThos in some way following the "dot com" model 
of releasing it freely to gain popularity and leveraging that down the road.  
I might sell advertisements, applications or support, but will stick to the 
[::/LT/Doc/Constitution.TXZ] LoseThos Constitution.

I learned with SimStructure that making money directly is nearly impossible.  
LoseThos would have been even less likely to make money directly, so it's 
distributed for free.


About Me:
I was a National Merit Scholar with a 1440 SAT at Arizona State
University.  I 
have a bachelor's in Computer System Engineering from ASU, basically,
embedded 
systems, and a master's in Electrical Engineering from ASU, control systems.  
I worked as a software, hardware and mechanical engineer at Ticketmaster from 
1990-1996.  I designed a 3 axis stepper-motor-driven milling machine
1996-1997 
with a CAD/CAM package for a company I started called Home Automation and 
Robotic Equipment.  I worked for a company named Xytec Corp. 1997-1999.  We 
made FPGA-based image processing equipment for currency inspection, and I 
installed passwords on the machine in the Bank of England.  I wrote 
SimStructure from 2000-2001 for H.A.R.E.  I worked as head
software/electrical 
engineer for a company called Graphic Technologies, 2001-2002, making 
replacement chips for toner printer cartridges so they could be refilled. 

All you need to know in life is that God is just.  Personally, I'm not sure 
what I deserve.
