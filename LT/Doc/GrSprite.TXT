A GrSprite, is one of the [C:/LT/Adam/Gr/Gr.APZ,2] following elements,
created with <CTRL-R>.  Several 
sprite elements are clustered together by <CTRL-R>.  Normally, they are
packed 
together in a list and the addr of the first is passed to routines.

See [::/LT/Demo/Graphics/GrSprite1.CPZ] ::/LT/Demo/Graphics/GrSprite1.CPZ,
[::/LT/Demo/Graphics/GrSprite2.CPZ] ::/LT/Demo/Graphics/GrSprite2.CPZ and 
[::/LT/Demo/Graphics/GrSprite3.CPZ] ::/LT/Demo/Graphics/GrSprite3.CPZ and
[C:/LT/Adam/Gr/GrSpriteMesh.APZ,875] GrSpriteMesh().

Be aware that copying PI, IB, or IS entries with the clipboard results in 
duplicate entries with different nums.  You can manually remove dups by 
editing with <CTRL-T> and setting to the original num.
