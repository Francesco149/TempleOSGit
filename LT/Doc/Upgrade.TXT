                              Upgrading LoseThos

To upgrade, you generally boot the new LoseThos CD/DVD, install on top of
your 
partition, modify your files and set it to boot your account by executing 
[C:/LT/Adam/Boot/InsBoot.APZ,157] InstallBoot().  Often, your code will have
to be modified to work with the new 
version.  See [::/LT/Doc/ChangeLog.TXZ] ChangeLog.  You might have to boot an
alternate partition or the 
CD and modify your code until it boots okay.

The INSTALL option when you boot a CD will install on top of an existing 
install if you tell it not to delete the /LT directory.

See the [::/LT/Doc/Install.TXZ] Installing documentation.
