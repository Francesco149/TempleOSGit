+] DIRECTORY STRUCTURE
    /LT/Accts Each subdirectory is an acct.  When you boot, you can select an
    acct to login to, unless you compile OSMain soas to pick one.  Your acct
    directory is your HOME directory and all your user data should be placed in
    here to ease backing-up your data.  When you Install an application it will
    create a subdirectory of your HOME directory for storage.

/LT/Apps Applications are placed in subdirectories of /LT/Apps.  Applications
    should have a file called Install.CPZ which will install the app for the
    current user acct.  The file, Load.CPZ will load the application into mem. 
    The file, Run.CPZ, will usually load and execute the app.  To add an app to
    your personal menu, use <CTRL-L>, insert a macro with the PopUp option
    checked and invoke the Run.CPZ file.

/LT/Demo Here you can find lots of sample code to do various things.

/LT/Doc Here you can find documentation.

/LT/OSMain The core of the operating system is found here.  Since priviledge
    levels are not used, calling it a "kernel" would be confusing, but that's
    what it is.  It is statically compiled by [C:/LT/Adam/Boot/InsBoot.APZ,157]
    InstallBoot().  It is loaded by the boot loader and must fit in 640K.

/LT/Compiler The compiler module src code is found here.  The compiler is
    statically compiled to produce a binary file which is loaded at boot.  It is
    also statically compiled by [C:/LT/Adam/Boot/InsBoot.APZ,157] InstallBoot().

/LT/Adam The non-kernel part of the operating system is found here.  It is
    JIT compiled during boot.

  +] DOLLAR SIGN CMDS
    [::/LT/Doc/Dollar.TXZ] Dollar Sign Cmds are rich-text cmds.  The editor,
    compiler, assembler and operating system are seamlessly equiped to handle
    LoseThos rich text.  Cmds like [C:/LT/OSMain/Dsk/Dsk1b.CPZ,234] Dir() and
    [C:/LT/Adam/Grep.APZ,161] Grep() can output links to the cmd line.

  +] CMD PROMPT
    The LoseThos cmd line interface is based on C/C++. Explore the ".CPZ"
    files.  A cmd which takes no args may be executed by typing the name and a
    semicolon.  Cmds with args require placing the arg in parentheses like a
    function call.


Dir("*");
`Dir("*");`
 will list files in the current directory.

Dir;
`Dir;`
 uses default of "*".

Cd("::/LT/Apps");
`Cd("::/LT/Apps");`
 will change directories.

Directories are referenced with "/" not "\".  The Boot drive is referred to
    with "::".  Other drives are referred to by a letter and a colon.  Your user
    acct directory is referred to with "HOME".

If a file is not found in one directory, all it's parents are searched. 

Ed("FILENAME.TXZ"); Invokes the editor.  See [::/LT/Doc/Ed.TXZ] Editor cmds. 
    Note that editor cmds work practically everywhere--like at the cmd prompt or
    within help.

Some cmds like [C:/LT/Adam/Grep.APZ,161] Grep() take a "find_files_mask". 
    They begin with the name of a dir tree and end with a list of filename masks.
     See [C:/LT/OSMain/Dsk/DskStr.CPZ,32] FilesFindMatch().

Grep("pattern","/LT/Demo/*.CPZ;*.TXZ;");

Be aware of [C:/LT/OSMain/Adam1a.HPZ,2065] TEXT_FILE_MASK and
    [C:/LT/OSMain/Adam1a.HPZ,2064] SRC_FILE_MASK.


  +] BURNING CD-ROMs/DVDs
    0) Prepare a directory with the files you wish to burn.
1) Use [C:/LT/Adam/Dsk/DskCDDVD.APZ,376] CDFileCreate() to make an ISO image
    file.
2) Use [C:/LT/OSMain/Dsk/Dsk1c.CPZ,281] CDImageWrite() to burn an ISO file
    onto a CD or DVD.
