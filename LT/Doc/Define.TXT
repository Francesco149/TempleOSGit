To allow different languages and customization, LoseThos uses strings to 
identify actual strings to be displayed.  This is basically a level of 
indirection.  Support for lists of strings is also provided, but it's not 
especially efficient.

Each task can load it's own Define strings.  If a string is not found, the 
parent task's table is searched.
