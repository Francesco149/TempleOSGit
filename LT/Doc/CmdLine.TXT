The cmd line feeds into a C+ compiler as you type.  A statement outside a 
function executes immediately.  Remember to add a semicolon.

Look-up the function headers with WordStat by hitting <CTRL-SHIFT-F1> after 
typing the first few letters.

[C:/LT/OSMain/Dsk/Dsk1b.CPZ,236] Click Here to see the directory cmd
header.  It accepts default args from C++.

Dir("*.TXZ");

If you don't have args, you don't need parenthesis.

Dir;

There is a current directory, but not a path.  To run a program, you
typically 
#include it.  There are several shortcuts for #includeing files.  Right-click 
or hit enter on a directory listing or press F5 while editing.

Ed("NewFile.CPZ");

Most filenames end in 'Z' because they are stored compressed if the last 
letter is 'Z'.

Drives are specified with a letter.  The boot drive is specified with a ':'.

Drv('B');		B drive

The drive can be specified in a [C:/LT/OSMain/Dsk/Dsk1b.CPZ,39] Cd() command
as in:

Cd("B:/Temp");		B drive
Cd("::/LT/Demo");	Boot drive

Cd("HOME/MusicOrgan");	HOME is a dir

You can place macros in your personal menu for
[C:/LT/OSMain/Dsk/Dsk1b.CPZ,39] Cd() commands.  <WINDOWS KEY> 
to access your menu.
