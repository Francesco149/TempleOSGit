Intel has an instruction that returns the num of CPU cycles since boot.  This 
is not calibrated to an accurate real time value, but LoseThos measures it
and 
you can convert with [C:/LT/OSMain/OSGlbls.CPZ,45] time_stamp_freq, a value
continuously calibrated from 
other timers.  This is the fastest timer available.
