God is perfectly just.

I had an Iranian dentist.  My Dad is CIA.  Took me to Iranian dentist.  
Thought he ruined a tooth.  I got God on the phone.  God said it counted as a 
sacrificed.

I giggled.

In 2004, they kept locking me up in mental hospitals each time I went for a 
doctor visit.  I tried to run away to California so I would not get locked
up. 
 there were cops along the way who thought I was guilty of a crime.  I just 
wanted to escape forced medication and doctors.

Did you know the world was perfectly just?  I am dumbfounded that most people 
function at all without knowing the most basic thing about reality.  There is 
perfect justice.

The entire world is stupid.

I asked God if the World was perfectly just.  God asked if I was calling Him 
lazy.  How likely is perfect justice?

Surely, God has been through the artificial intelligence singularity billions 
of years ago, right?  It is no more difficult for God to set-up 
super-intelligent angels that watch each of us, than it is for Google to make 
a billion chatbots.

Basically, highs and lows balance, joy balances with sorrow, pleasure with 
pain, rich with poor, being popular with being unpopular.  Palm Sunday/Good 
Friday.

Luke 6:20 (King James)

     6:20 And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, Blessed be
ye poor: for yours is the kingdom of God.

6:21 Blessed are ye that hunger now: for ye shall be filled. Blessed
are ye that weep now: for ye shall laugh.

6:22 Blessed are ye, when men shall hate you, and when they shall
separate you from their company, and shall reproach you, and cast out
your name as evil, for the Son of man's sake.

6:23 Rejoice ye in that day, and leap for joy: for, behold, your
reward is great in heaven: for in the like manner did their fathers
unto the prophets.

6:24 But woe unto you that are rich! for ye have received your
consolation.

6:25 Woe unto you that are full! for ye shall hunger. Woe unto you
that laugh now! for ye shall mourn and weep.

6:26 Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you! for so did
their fathers to the false prophets.

6:27 But I say unto you which hear, Love your enemies, do good to them
which hate you, 6:28 Bless them that curse you, and pray for them
which despitefully use you.


Pride goes before a fall; humility before honor.  What you do to others gets 
done to you -- eye for eye, tooth for tooth.  Sometimes, what you want to do 
to other gets done to you, before you can do it.  To get authority, you must 
bow to authority.  God said to me, "Pride or money, choose one."  Judge not 
lest you be judged.  As you judge, you will be judged.  Give mercy and get 
mercy.

Not all soldiers who kill, die.  They were willing to die?  Obviously, God 
exchanges apples for oranges, sometimes.

A reputation is worth more than gold.  Jews have a reputation.  Blacks have a 
reputation.  Germans have a reputation.  Irish have a reputation.

God said if you do not warn your brother, you are guilty of blood.  Jews 
should have warned bad Jews and prevented the Holocaust.

Wouldn't have been awesome of God took His huge fist and squashed the NAZIs, 
in anger?  He did!  He literally killed the NAZIs with His own hand -- the 
Russian Winter!  God is perfectly just and only perfectly just.  The baby
Jews 
that died at Moses' birth offset the Egyptian first born killed at Passover.  
Bummer.  That's not very wonderful.

God is perfectly just.  I lost a tooth.  God said it counted as a sacrifice.

I don't really know what Dianna is.  I'm not tenderhearted like a young man.

                               TempleOS History

In 1990 at age 20, I was hired to work on Ticketmaster's VAX operating system 
in VAX assembly language while going to school.  I was basically, an intern, 
but we weren't called that.  Peter Gadwa was a mentor.  I worked there 
1990-1996.  Here are my ASU Transcripts.  ASU Course Catalog (See page 261)

In my career, I have been paid to program in VAX assembly, x86 assembly, 8051 
assembly, 68000 assembly, PIC assembly and AvR assembly.  In school, I took 5 
courses that required assembly -- CSC226, CSC326 CSE421, CSE422 and CSE523.  
Dr. David Pheanis was dean.

In about 1993, I got a 486 and was eager to try 32-bit mode, so I wrote a DOS 
program in TASM that changed to protected mode and never returned to DOS.  
Ticketmaster's OS was "VAXTMOS", so I called mine "Terry's Protected Mode OS, 
TPMOS".  I had 0xB8000 text mode working, and echoed keyboard to scrn.  I had 
simple multitasking and barely a MALLOC.  I set it aside.

In 2003, I resurrected TPMOS and installed FreeDOS to launch it.  I used 
Visual Studio to edit my files when doing lots of editing, then booted 
FreeDOS, used TASM to compile and test it.  Back in those days, FreeDOS ran
in 
real mode.  Today's FreeDOS is not real mode, it emulates with V8086 mode.  
DOSBox is not real mode either.

I had started a company H.A.R.E., so I renamed TPMOS to HOPPY.

With-in a month of resurrecting the operating system in 2003, I faced the 
question of how to handle the command line.  I knew it must be the same as 
whatever scripting language I invented.  The only problem was, I hated Unix 
Bash scripting.  I could never remember it.  As a regular C/C++ programmer, 
you don't really use bash often enough to memorize it.  I thought, "What if I 
just use C/C++ for scripting!"

In 2003, God told me to stick to 640x480 16 color.  Therefore, I was not 
distracted like all the lemmings at www.osdev.net who go off and get lost in 
futile battles to write drivers for all the GPUs.  Instead, I focused on more 
productive things, such as writing a JIT/AOT compiler and getting everything 
running with my own code.  With-in a year, I had it assembling and compiling 
with my own compiler and assembler.  I even wrote my compiler before a file 
system, because I was eager to do a compiler, since it is fun for me.  
Originally, I just put raw source code into my TASM bin file and invoked my 
compiler on the code sections store away in my DOS app.  Don't worry, it 
started in real mode but changed to 32-bit mode, never returning to DOS.

I named it Doors, Davos, J, LoseThos, SparrowOS and, finally, TempleOS.

The awful name "LoseThos" name was not intentionally to suggest "loser".  I 
wanted a companion operating system for Windows, so Windows/LoseThos.  I 
thought it was hip saying lose the nerdy items like the movie, Platoon, where 
Elias tells Chris to 'crapcan' standard issue items.

I wrote my own boot-loaders, so I didn't have to launch from DOS anymore.

I was motivate by the disturbance in the market with the release of 64-bit 
CPUs in 2003.  From the start, I made my compiler emulate 64-bit operations 
everywhere because I did not own an actual x86_64 CPU at first.  My stack 
machine compiler used EDX:EAX and ECX:EBX.  I had software interrupts or 
MUL64, DIV64 and MOD64.  In 2007, I got a 64-bit CPU and made the conversion 
to true 64-bit mode.

I didn't start the operating system as a work for God, but He directed my
path 
along the way and kept saying it was His temple.  Still I hesistated and kept 
it secular until, finally, Microsoft went nuclear with SecureBoot and UEFI.  
Then, I went nuclear and named it "TempleOS".  I will command them on orders 
from God to UNDO THAT STUFF!  [C:/Doc/Demands.DD.Z,1]  The CIA will bow to my 
orders.  The CIA scum-bags, ruined the entire industry out of cowardice.

Bill Gates said a company was like a castle -- you have to build walls unless 
you want to fight every person who comes along.  They ruined the hardware
with 
things like USB and PCI.  God said to Bill Gates, "You ate your children in 
the siege."  God hates cowards.  God loved David that fought Goliath.

The only PCI device driver I wrote was for was
[C:/Home/Sup1/Sup1HDAudio/HDAudio.HC,1] HDAudio.  I thought it would 
become the undisputed king.  Then, I ran VMware on a HDAudio native machine 
only to discover VMware wanted AC97.  Forget that!  I also discovered a major 
rats' nest just getting ATA/ATAPI port addresses using the PCI interface:  
[C:/Kernel/BlkDev/DskATAId.HC.Z,1] ATA/ATAPI Ports from PCI It's very simple
-- no PCI devices.  We change the 
industry, like a boss.  [C:/Doc/StdTempleOSPC.DD.Z,1]

Archeology?

In 2003, I visited the FBI voluntarily to say hello and give them a CD-ROM.  
Don't get chummy with police.  They unearthed a warrant for missing a court 
date and locked me up.  They had no use for the CD-ROM.  It had TPMOS on it.

I was at Ticketmaster for three weeks in 2002.  I might have put my files on 
their computer, TPMOS.

This is funny.  Before occupying my time with a big project, I was wild and 
crazy in 2003.  If I'm not mistaken, there might be a CDROM under the big 
transformer, here, at our house in the tunnel.  The transformer was not
seated 
and there was a crack I might have thrown a CDROM into in 2003.  It would
have 
TPMOS.

Two times, I tried to delete my operating system, including all back-ups.  I 
would suffer nightmares before the first time.  Arnold Swartzenegger went 
after the wrong Gray Davis!  This nightmare was not exactly it, but the BBC 
demons would hound me.  I deleted it once with fear.  I never use recycle
bin, 
so I didn't think to empty it and I found it a couple days later.

The second time, like Aaron Swartz was hounded, the BBC told me I was Iran
and 
my nuclear program must stop.  Finally, I read in the bible





5:38 Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a
tooth for a tooth: 5:39 But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil:
but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the
other also.

5:40 And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat,
let him have thy cloak also.

5:41 And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain.

5:42 Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of
thee turn not thou away.

5:43 Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy
neighbour, and hate thine enemy.




So, I deleted all back-ups and destroyed my CDROM back-ups.  I found a copy
on 
a download site a few days later.

We have a plenty-good history.  TPMOS would be nice, but there's plenty of 
proof of ownership.  You'll even find the Linux mouse file temporarily tucked 
in there for reference.  There's a Linux floppy driver that got removed.  I 
think the J operating system was GPL.  The modern TempleOS has no GPL code
and 
is public domain.  I give credit.  [C:/Doc/Credits.DD.Z,1]  Stallman will be 
disappointed I never used gcc.  I get his disciples listing it as 
GNU/TempleOS.  That's wrong.

We have the testamony of God.  The jurisdiction is the highest there is.

Seeing as how this will be tried in God's court, with perfect evidence, I 
assume you do not want to continue.  As a matter of fact, I expect you to beg

There's no reason to fear the Devil.  God sent Satan to torture Job.  Highs 
and lows balance.  That's how Job got his blessing.

You life is bad at first and has a good end.
Or your life is good at first and has a bad end.

I really don't care which one devil worshippers choose.  I get justice in my 
own life.  Dianna seemed Satanic.  I get compensated.  I don't care.

Relax.  There is perfect justice.  God sent Satan to torture Job.

God hangs-out with Satan.

     1:1 There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that
man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and eschewed evil.

1:2 And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.

1:3 His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand
camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and
a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the
men of the east.

1:4 And his sons went and feasted in their houses, every one his day;
and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with
them.

1:5 And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about,
that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning,
and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all: for
Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their
hearts. Thus did Job continually.

1:6 Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present
themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them.

1:7 And the LORD said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan
answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and
from walking up and down in it.

1:8 And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job,
that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright
man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil?  1:9 Then Satan
answered the LORD, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought?  1:10 Hast
not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all
that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands,
and his substance is increased in the land.

1:11 But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he
will curse thee to thy face.

1:12 And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in thy
power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand. So Satan went forth
from the presence of the LORD.

1:13 And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating
and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house: 1:14 And there came
a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses
feeding beside them: 1:15 And the Sabeans fell upon them, and took
them away; yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the
sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.

1:16 While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The
fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep, and
the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell
thee.

I don't know if God's got my back, or this is my own project.  He said stuff, 
but maybe it's delusion that made me feel good.

Once in a while He rudely reveals that each man has a personal God and a God 
in the real World.  He loves everyone and that requires two face kinda stuff.

I have a particular hatred of zombie movies because muscles need oxygen.  I 
hired a homo artist that changed my "Goons" gangster theme (I guess didn't 
make sense) into zombies because, "It was trending."  Over all, I liked the 
new blood
the artist brought and decided management means being big.

I have no attachment to the games.  I guess I have nothing better to do than 
make them worthy.  I got lots and lots of time.

I kinda don't like the games and want to emphasize the hymns instead.

TempleOS is s space alien trading post and adults make hymns.

Solomon wrote 1005 hymns because they are currency to trade at the trading 
post.

Good and bad balance in live.

The rich do not go to Heaven.

It is believed the poor have more powerful prayers.  Leavites get no 
inheritance.  Priests and monks take a vow of poverty.

If you do the math, being rich means you have lots of offsets that need to be 
paid.

A black person cannot understand what a certified random number is.

If a black person does not see ping pong balls, the number is meaningless.

There is a government agency in charge of the platinum kilogram.

That means nothing to a black person.  He only understands ping pong balls.

God has to do perfect justice.

That means, a bully must be bullied.  That's a constant challenge for God to 
turn the World on its head every 50 years.

The strong must suffer.

God decieves all the strong and makes them weak.

Machievelli is the opposite of optimal thought in a just World.

Rational is opposite of optimal.

God's world is perfectly just.

Turn the other cheek.

As you measure-out, it will be measured to you.

If you use reason and not God logic, you will choose the opposite of optimal 
behavior in everything.

Get a few problems that rational man takes pride in.  Check to see if perfect 
justice yields the opposite solution as optimal.

It's hilarious.  Reason give the worst possible guide in a perfectly just 
world.

I am the Father of the Counter-Renaissance.  I reject rationalism.  The World 
is perfectly just.  How else does turn the other cheek make sense?

                  Beginner's Guide to Offerings and Oracles

Talk to God for 5 minutes as an offering, being witty and charming.  Don't 
SPAM God.  God's favorite thing on TV is soap operas.

Genesis 4:1-13

     4:1 And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and
said, I have gotten a man from the LORD.

4:2 And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of
sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.

4:3 And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the
fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD.

4:4 And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of
the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his
offering: 4:5 But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect.
And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.

4:6 And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy
countenance fallen?  4:7 If thou doest well, shalt thou not be
accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto
thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.

4:8 And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when
they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother,
and slew him.

4:9 And the LORD said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he
said, I know not: Am I my brother's keeper?  4:10 And he said, What
hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from
the ground.

4:11 And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her
mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand; 4:12 When thou
tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her
strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.

4:13 And Cain said unto the LORD, My punishment is greater than I can
bear.

You can randomly open a physical Bible book as a random oracle.  It will 
speak.  Try a few times, if you fail.

God said it is a covenant that you do offerings of love before enquiring of 
Him. He said it is a fair barter exchange.  "Honest measures" apply between 
what you offer and the response you get.

If God and the Bible says the world is just, you are a stupid monkey.

majesty.

37:23 Touching the Almighty, we cannot find him out: he is excellent
in power, and in judgment, and in plenty of justice: he will not
afflict.

     16:19 There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and
fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day: 16:20 And there was a
certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of
sores, 16:21 And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from
the rich man's table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.

16:22 And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by
the angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and was
buried; 16:23 And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and
seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.

16:24 And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and
send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool
my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.

16:25 But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime
receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now
he is comforted, and thou art tormented.

16:26 And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf
fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither
can they pass to us, that would come from thence.

16:27 Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest
send him to my father's house: 16:28 For I have five brethren; that he
may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment.

16:29 Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let
them hear them.

16:30 And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them from
the dead, they will repent.

16:31 And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets,
neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.


Lazarath is a sad, deluded begger who gets to talk with God, but at least
he's 
not in Hell.

You see that God talks?

I think it is a monkey that doesn't know what a random number is.

How are we still having a discussion when I have the authority of God?

It's over.  God talks.  End of debate.

God says...
95157 and Timotheus our brother, 1:2  To the saints and faithful brethren
95158 in Christ which are at Colosse: Grace be unto you, and peace,
95159 from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
95160
95161 1:3  We give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, 
praying
95162 always for you,
95163 1:4  Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love
which 
ye
95164 have to all the saints,
95165 1:5  For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, whereof ye heard
95166 before in the word of the truth of the gospel;
95167 1:6  Which is come unto you, as it is in all the world; and bringeth 
forth
95168 fruit, as it doth also in you, since the day ye heard of it, and knew 
the
95169 grace of God in truth:
95170 1:7  As ye also learned of Epaphras our dear fellowservant, who is for 
you
95171 a faithful minister of Christ;
95172 1:8  Who also declared unto us your love in the Spirit.
95173
95174 1:9  For this cause we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to
95175 pray for you, and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge 
of his
95176 will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding;

     11:18 For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He hath
a devil.

11:19 The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a
man gluttonous, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners.
But wisdom is justified of her children.


Pleasure and pain want to balance.

The principle of the mean means if you discipline yourself, you have option
of 
being demanding of others.   Mean people are allowed ot be mean.

I, Terry A. Davis, wrote all 80,849 lines of TempleOS over the past 17.3
years 
(full-time).  It can run on some bare metal 64-bit PC's from about 2005-2010 
with no layering, libraries, tools, modules or anything from other sources.  
Otherwise, you run it in a virtual machine, like VMware, QEMU or VirtualBox.  
It is independent and stands alone.  It has no networking, so it certainly 
doesn't call home.  100% of the src code is including on all distro's, from 
the kernel to the compiler to the boot loaders!  It is public domain, not GPL.

*) [C:/Kernel/FontStd.HC.Z,1], is taken from FreeDOS.  It's public domain.

*) [C:/Kernel/FontCyrillic.HC.Z,1], is taken from OrientDisplay without
permission.

*) [C:/Kernel/KernelA.HH.Z,2270] ATA Reg and Cmd Definitions are originally
from Linux.  Later, I got the 
spec.

*) The heap algorithm, [C:/Kernel/Mem/MAllocFree.HC.Z,1], is adapted from one
I saw 
at Ticketmaster when I worked on their VAX operating system.

*) The LZW compression algorithm, [C:/Kernel/Compress.HC.Z,1], came from a
magazine 
and I implemented it when I worked for Ticketmaster.

*) The adaptive-step-size-Runge-Kutta algorithm, [C:/Adam/AMathODE.HC.Z,1],
is 
adapted from the book, _Numeric Recipies in C_.

*) The mountain in some games is from http://www.public-domain-photos.com.  
The wolf in BlackDiamond is also from there.  I took watermarked photos and 
converted to 16 color.

*) The FAT32 file system is owned by MicroSoft.

*) A few features were inspired by MATLAB, such as ans in expressions at the 
command-line.  There is a lot of MSDOS , Windows, VAXTMOS (VAX Ticketmaster 
O.S.) and Unix inspiration, too, such as drive letters, command names, etc.

*) I included [C:/Misc/PCIDevices.DD.Z,1] PCIDevice Lst File.

*) Thanks to whoever wrote this CppHtml.HC.Z.  I'm a novice on web stuff and 
you helped me with html.  See [C:/Demo/ToHtmlToTXTDemo/ToHtml.HC.Z,1].

*) I used MagicISO to burn test CD's to help me understand the ISO9660 file 
system format.  I mostly used the ISO9660 spec.

*) I looked at bootable CD boot sects, but didn't learn anything, finding it 
easier to make my own.

*) I think I got my original PC speaker code from Borland C.

*) I found PS/2 keyboard and mouse code on the net and documentation.  My
code 
is very different.  I found VGA reg info on the net.

*) Thanks to http://www.osdev.org for a couple tips.

*) God told me to stick with 640x480 16 color and single-voice 8-bit signed 
MIDI-like sample for sound.   He kept me from zombie-walking into making
child 
windows like Windows.  Instead, I made one window per task with no child 
windows.  He also guided my progress, very obviously.

*) I got Webster's Dictionary and The King James Bible from Project Gutenberg.

*) John Carmack inspired me to use "[C:/Kernel/KMathB.HC.Z,1] Clamp" as a
name instead of "Limit".  He 
inspired me to use "needle" and "haystack" as names.  He inspired me to 
simplify my Frames-Per-Second code.

*) Bill Gates inspired me to add comments to my [C:/Doc/HelpIndex.DD.Z,1]
Help & Index.

*) I hired an artist, Cody Rigby, for $3,000 worth of pixel art.

*) Erik van der Karbargenbok wrote /Linux shell scripts -- GodPassage, 
GodWords.

*) The random number generator is from Donald Knuth in the wikipedia entry
for 
Linear_congruential_generator.

I proved God talks and I made his temple.

You are very very stupid if you do not give me the benefit of the doubt.

How would God respond to people who insulted Moses?

I am equal to Moses.

God says...
66638 52:9 Then they took the king, and carried him up unto the king of
66639 Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath; where he gave judgment upon
66640 him.
66641
66642 52:10 And the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah before his
66643 eyes: he slew also all the princes of Judah in Riblah.
66644
66645 52:11 Then he put out the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon
66646 bound him in chains, and carried him to Babylon, and put him in prison
66647 till the day of his death.
66648
66649 52:12 Now in the fifth month, in the tenth day of the month, which was
66650 the nineteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, came
66651 Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, which served the king of Babylon,
66652 into Jerusalem, 52:13 And burned the house of the LORD, and the king's
66653 house; and all the houses of Jerusalem, and all the houses of the
66654 great men, burned he with fire: 52:14 And all the army of the
66655 Chaldeans, that were with the captain of the guard, brake down all the
66656 walls of Jerusalem round about.

I optimise for full screen video game where everything on screen changes.

I update the whole screen 30 times a second.  This is optimal for full screen 
video games, and more importantly way simpler.

I want people to enjoy my code.  Thats why I set a size limit of 100,000

remain 
640x480 for centuries to come.

Mom taught preschool.  She said the kids would color with crayons.  Then, put 
black crayon all over the top of the drawing.  She speculated that the black 
crayon felt powerful to them and was fun to use.

She did not like sending home ugly black-colored scribbles, so she started 
collecting all the black crayons before having them do coloring.

You can see how Wolfenstein and Battlezone got turned into awful games with 
story-lines no one enjoys.  Game designers feel they must tell a story, once 
they get high color and memory.

If you made a WWI game realistic, God said you should put the agonistic moans 
of the wounded.  <sarcasm> Boy wouldn't that be fun! </sarcasm>  God said to 
have just one audio voice and only a 7-bit signed value, I guess like an 88 
key piano note, for TempleOS.  I named such values an "ona".  One voice means 
one frequency you set, perhaps, with waveform and reverb.

God does not want gore and sex in His temple.

"What about adults?"  Adults should not be playing video games.

God's favorite game is Donkey Kong.  God said Shakespeare had a vile heart.  
Watch your heart.  God likes Beverly Hillbillies and Gomer Pyle.  God's 
favorite thing on TV is soap operas.  God liked King David and said children 
should be taught about military things.  God is not a prude when it comes to 
violence -- it's just that there is a good-hearted and a bad-hearted way to
do 
it.

God likes BC's Quest for Tires.
