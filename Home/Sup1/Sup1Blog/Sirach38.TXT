Vocations of the Skilled Worker and the Scribe*

24The scribegammacos wisdom increases wisdom;
whoever is free from toil can become wise.
25How can one become learned who guides the plow,
and thrills in wielding the goad like a lance,
Who guides the ox and urges on the bullock,
and whose every concern is for cattle?
26His concern is to plow furrows,
and he is careful to fatten the livestock.
27So with every engraver and designer
who, laboring night and day,
Fashions carved seals,
and whose concern is to vary the pattern.
His determination is to produce a lifelike impression,
and he is careful to finish the work.
28So too the smith sitting by the anvil,
intent on the iron he forges.
The flame from the fire sears his flesh,
yet he toils away in the furnace heat.
The clang of the hammer deafens his ears;
his eyes are on the object he is shaping.
His determination is to finish the work,
and he is careful to perfect it in detail.
29So also the potter sitting at his labor,
revolving the wheel with his feet.
He is always concerned for his products,
and turns them out in quantity.
30With his hands he molds the clay,
and with his feet softens it.
His determination is to complete the glazing,
and he is careful to fire the kiln.
31All these are skilled with their hands,
each one an expert at his own work;
32Without them no city could be lived in,
and wherever they stay, they do not go hungry.
But they are not sought out for the council of the people,
33nor are they prominent in the assembly.
They do not sit on the judgegammacos bench,
nor can they understand law and justice.
They cannot expound discipline or judgment,
nor are they found among the rulers.
34Yet they maintain the fabric of the world,
and their concern is for exercise of their skill.
