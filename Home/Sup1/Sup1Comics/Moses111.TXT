+] Interpretation
  I asked God why the seven plagues in Exodus?  He still ended-up just
  killing them in the Sea.  They paid no attention.  God said it was like the
  Old West where the bad guy must draw his gun and make himself guilty enough
  to kill.  God sited the movie, Unforgiven, where a man shot a man on "the
  shitter".  It's not really sport for God to kill people.




God says...
4:5 Then called Esther for Hatach, one of the king's chamberlains,
whom he had appointed to attend upon her, and gave him a commandment
to Mordecai, to know what it was, and why it was.

4:6 So Hatach went forth to Mordecai unto the street of the city,
which was before the king's gate.

4:7 And Mordecai told him of all that had happened unto him, and of
the sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the king's
treasuries for the Jews, to destroy them.

4:8 Also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was
given at Shushan to destroy them, to shew it unto Esther, and to
declare it unto her, and to charge her that she should go in unto the
king, to make supplication unto him, and to make request before him
for her people.

4:9 And Hatach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai.

  This is an alternative approach God could have taken.  He could have
  manipulated the Pharoah and made a civil war or somehting.  Never
  underestimate God's ability to make any enemy instantly fight themselves.
