    There were a lot of things we couldn't do in an SR-71, but we were the 
fastest guys on the block and loved reminding our fellow aviators of this 
fact. People often asked us if, because of this fact, it was fun to fly the 
jet. Fun would not be the first word I would use to describe flying this 
plane. Intense, maybe. Even cerebral. But there was one day in our Sled 
experience when we would have to say that it was pure fun to be the fastest 
guys out there, at least for a moment.

    It occurred when Walt and I were flying our final training sortie. We 
needed 100 hours in the jet to complete our training and attain Mission Ready 
status. Somewhere over Colorado we had passed the century mark. We had made 
the turn in Arizona and the jet was performing flawlessly. My gauges were 
wired in the front seat and we were starting to feel pretty good about 
ourselves, not only because we would soon be flying real missions but because 
we had gained a great deal of confidence in the plane in the past ten months. 
Ripping across the barren deserts 80,000 feet below us, I could already see 
the coast of California from the Arizona border. I was, finally, after many 
humbling months of simulators and study, ahead of the jet.

    I was beginning to feel a bit sorry for Walter in the back seat. There he 
was, with no really good view of the incredible sights before us, tasked with 
monitoring four different radios. This was good practice for him for when we 
began flying real missions, when a priority transmission from headquarters 
could be vital. It had been difficult, too, for me to relinquish control of 
the radios, as during my entire flying career I had controlled my own 
transmissions. But it was part of the division of duties in this plane and I 
had adjusted to it. I still insisted on talking on the radio while we were on 
the ground, however. Walt was so good at many things, but he couldn't match
my 
expertise at sounding smooth on the radios, a skill that had been honed 
sharply with years in fighter squadrons where the slightest radio miscue was 
grounds for beheading. He understood that and allowed me that luxury.

    Just to get a sense of what Walt had to contend with, I pulled the radio 
toggle switches and monitored the frequencies along with him. The predominant 
radio chatter was from Los Angeles Center, far below us, controlling daily 
traffic in their sector. While they had us on their scope (albeit briefly),
we 
were in uncontrolled airspace and normally would not talk to them unless we 
needed to descend into their airspace.

    We listened as the shaky voice of a lone Cessna pilot asked Center for a 
readout of his ground speed. Center replied: "November Charlie 175, I'm 
showing you at ninety knots on the ground."

    Now the thing to understand about Center controllers, was that whether 
they were talking to a rookie pilot in a Cessna, or to Air Force One, they 
always spoke in the exact same, calm, deep, professional, tone that made one 
feel important. I referred to it as the " Houston Center voice." I have
always 
felt that after years of seeing documentaries on this country's space program 
and listening to the calm and distinct voice of the Houston controllers, that 
all other controllers since then wanted to sound like that, and that they 
basically did. And it didn't matter what sector of the country we would be 
flying in, it always seemed like the same guy was talking. Over the years
that 
tone of voice had become somewhat of a comforting sound to pilots everywhere. 
Conversely, over the years, pilots always wanted to ensure that, when 
transmitting, they sounded like Chuck Yeager, or at least like John Wayne. 
Better to die than sound bad on the radios.

    Just moments after the Cessna's inquiry, a Twin Beech piped up on 
frequency, in a rather superior tone, asking for his ground speed. "I have
you 
at one hundred and twenty-five knots of ground speed." Boy, I thought, the 
Beechcraft really must think he is dazzling his Cessna brethren. Then out of 
the blue, a navy F-18 pilot out of NAS Lemoore came up on frequency. You knew 
right away it was a Navy jock because he sounded very cool on the radios. 
"Center, Dusty 52 ground speed check". Before Center could reply, I'm
thinking 
to myself, hey, Dusty 52 has a ground speed indicator in that million-dollar 
cockpit, so why is he asking Center for a readout? Then I got it, ol' Dusty 
here is making sure that every bug smasher from Mount Whitney to the Mojave 
knows what true speed is. He's the fastest dude in the valley today, and he 
just wants everyone to know how much fun he is having in his new Hornet. And 
the reply, always with that same, calm, voice, with more distinct
alliteration 
than emotion: "Dusty 52, Center, we have you at 620 on the ground."

    And I thought to myself, is this a ripe situation, or what? As my hand 
instinctively reached for the mic bttn, I had to remind myself that Walt was 
in control of the radios. Still, I thought, it must be done - in mere seconds 
we'll be out of the sector and the opportunity will be lost. That Hornet must 
die, and die now. I thought about all of our Sim training and how important
it 
was that we developed well as a crew and knew that to jump in on the radios 
now would destroy the integrity of all that we had worked toward becoming. I 
was torn.

    Somewhere, 13 miles above Arizona, there was a pilot screaming inside his 
space helmet. Then, I heard it. The click of the mic bttn from the back seat. 
That was the very moment that I knew Walter and I had become a crew. Very 
professionally, and with no emotion, Walter spoke: "Los Angeles Center, Aspen 
20, can you give us a ground speed check?" There was no hesitation, and the 
replay came as if was an everyday request. "Aspen 20, I show you at one 
thousand eight hundred and forty-two knots, across the ground."

    I think it was the forty-two knots that I liked the best, so accurate and 
proud was Center to deliver that information without hesitation, and you just 
knew he was smiling. But the precise point at which I knew that Walt and I 
were going to be really good friends for a long time was when he keyed the
mic 
once again to say, in his most fighter-pilot-like voice: "Ah, Center, much 
thanks, we're showing closer to nineteen hundred on the money."

    For a moment Walter was a god. And we finally heard a little crack in the 
armor of the Houston Center voice, when L.A.came back with, "Roger that
Aspen, 
Your equipment is probably more accurate than ours. You boys have a good one."

    It all had lasted for just moments, but in that short, memorable sprint 
across the southwest, the Navy had been flamed, all mortal airplanes on freq 
were forced to bow before the King of Speed, and more importantly, Walter and 
I had crossed the threshold of being a crew. A fine day's work. We never
heard 
another transmission on that frequency all the way to the coast.

    For just one day, it truly was fun being the fastest guys out there.
