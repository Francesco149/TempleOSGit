A [C:/Doc/DolDocOverview.TXT.Z,1] DolDoc in memory is a [Data Types/Circular
Queue,1] Circular Queue of cmds and graphics.  See
[C:/Kernel/Adam1a.HPP.Z,1154] CDocEntry 
for the entry structure.  See [C:/Adam/Training.CPP.Z,200] TipOfDay() for a
nice example.

[C:/Doc/DolDocOverview.TXT.Z,1] DolDoc's are used for the editor, viewer,
browser, and cmd line.

There is one [C:/Kernel/Adam1a.HPP.Z,1317] CDoc for the task's border:
Fs->border_doc.  There is a pair for 
the task's client area: Fs->put_doc and Fs->display_doc.  You can,
optionally, 
do double buffering, otherwise Fs->put_doc is the same as Fs->display_doc.  
See [C:/Demo/Spy.CPP.Z,1].
