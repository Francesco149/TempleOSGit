"Input Ptr" is the mouse at this point.

[C:/Kernel/KGlbls.CPP.Z,79] ipx and [C:/Kernel/KGlbls.CPP.Z,79] ipy can be
used to access the x and y coordinates of the input ptr.  
They are relative to the screen, not window.  These can be used if you don't 
want to use msg passing.  [C:/Kernel/KGlbls.CPP.Z,79] ipz is the wheel.

[C:/Kernel/KGlbls.CPP.Z,85] iptx and [C:/Kernel/KGlbls.CPP.Z,86] ipty are the
text column and row of the input ptr.  See 
[C:/Demo/Games/Maze.CPP.Z,1].

You can make the input ptr snap to a grid by adjusting Fs->snap.
