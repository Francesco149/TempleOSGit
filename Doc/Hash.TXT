There is a symbol (hash) tables for each task.  When a sym is not found, the 
parent task's sym table is checked.  All tasks chain back to the Adam task.

TempleOS sym tables are implemented with an array of linked-lists.  A num is 
generated from a string by [C:/Kernel/KHashA.CPP.Z,299] HashStr() to index
into the array of linked-lists.  
Multiple strings can generate the same num, so linked-lists are built.  Newer 
entries overshadow older ones.  There are various types of entries.  See 
[C:/Kernel/KernelA.HPP.Z,646] Hash Entry Types.
