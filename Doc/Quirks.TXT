                                    Quirks

* You run a risk of problems if you do file operations on the same files 
simultaneously because there is **no file sharing/locking mechanism**. 
Generally, 
the last write wins.

* When using FAT32, TempleOS does not generate unique short-entry names, the 
ones with the ~s.  Not all FAT32 filenames are valid TempleOS names and it 
will complain.  Do not access FAT32 drives not dedicated to TempleOS. 
Disable 
them with [C:/Kernel/Dsk/DskAddDev.CPP.Z,151] DrvEnable(OFF), or they will
generate error messages.  FAT32 
involves a long and short name for each file.

* The stk does not grow because virtual mem is not used.  I recommend 
allocating large local vars from the heap.  You can change
[C:/Kernel/Adam1a.HPP.Z,2775] DFT_STK and 
recompile Kernel or request more when doing a [C:/Kernel/Task1a.CPP.Z,221]
Spawn().

* The syntax highlighting occassionally glitches.  The compiler doesn't.

* Call [C:/Kernel/Dsk/Dsk1a.CPP.Z,405] ChgDsk() when you insert a new
removable media.

* Accessing CD-ROM's is flacky.  Try [C:/Kernel/Dsk/Dsk1b.CPP.Z,12] Drv() or
[C:/Kernel/Dsk/Dsk1a.CPP.Z,405] ChgDsk() twice.

* You can only extern something once.  There is a varient called _extern
which 
binds a HolyC definition to a asm sym.  This, too, can only be done once.

* A terminal task has a [C:/Kernel/Adam1a.HPP.Z,1317] CDoc document structure
that remains active even when 
you change Fs->draw_it.  To prevent links in the
[C:/Kernel/Adam1a.HPP.Z,1317] CDoc from being activated 
when the user clicks in the window, do one of three things:
  
A) [C:/Adam/DolDoc/DocRecalc2a.CPP.Z,90] DocBottom() followed by
  [C:/Adam/DolDoc/DocRecalc2a.CPP.Z,103] DocClear() to clear the
  [C:/Kernel/Adam1a.HPP.Z,1317] CDoc so it has no active 
widgets.

B) Disable window mgr button click checking with Fs->win_inhibit set to mask 
[C:/Kernel/Adam1a.HPP.Z,1375] WIF_SELF_IP_L|[C:/Kernel/Adam1a.HPP.Z,1388]
  WIF_FOCUS_TASK_IP_L_D|[C:/Kernel/Adam1a.HPP.Z,1377]
  WIF_SELF_IP_R|[C:/Kernel/Adam1a.HPP.Z,1390] WIF_FOCUS_TASK_IP_R_D.  
This inhibits window mgr operations but still generates messages from button 
clicks.

* switch/case statements allocate a single jump table--do not use with wide, 
sparse ranges of case values.

* Don't do a goto out of a try{}.

* A goto label name must not match a global scope object's name.  (It's not 
worth slowing-down the compiler to handle this case.)

* [C:/Kernel/Adam1b.HPP.Z,138] MemCpy() only goes fwd.

* A [C:/Kernel/Dsk/Dsk1b.CPP.Z,37] Cd() cmd must be followed by two
semicolons if a #include is after it.  
This is because the preprocessor processes the next token ahead.

* The assembler's error msgs are often off by a line and undefines are 
cryptic.

* The last semicolon on the cmd line is converted to a dbl semicolon because 
the compiler looks ahead before doing a cmd.  This normally has no negative 
effect, but when entering if statements with else clauses it presents 
problems.

* You can do a class fwd reference by using extern on the first declaration, 
but you can only do ptr references to the class.

* When doing something like
      U0 Main()
{
  U16 *_w=0xA0000;
  *_w|=0x8000;
}
  The |= will be coded as a U32 Bts instruction resulting in a U32 access 
instead of a U16 access.  This affects some hardware operations.

* Compiler warning or error message line numbers will be off if you have a 
block of word-wrapped comments.  You might press <CTRL-t> before doing an 
editor goto-line-number command.
