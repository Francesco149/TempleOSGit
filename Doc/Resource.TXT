A sprite is an ordered list of elements such as lines, rectangles, bitmaps
and 
color changes.  In a program's source code, you first make a sprite somewhere 
outside a function.  Then, you insert a pointer to the sprite as an "*elems" 
arg when calling [C:/Adam/Gr/GrSpritePlot.CPP.Z,474] Sprite() or
[C:/Adam/Gr/GrSpritePlot.CPP.Z,18] Sprite3().  See [Sprites,1] Sprites.

You can create a sprite macro on your [C:/Home/PersonalMenu.TXT,1]
PersonalMenu with a payload of [C:/Doc/HolyC.TXT.Z,1] HolyC 
source code to execute when it ESC's back to the cmd line.  If you check 
"Pop-Up", it will spawn a new task and run the payload.  A pop-up macro can
be 
placed in any document.
