A sprite is an ordered list of elements such as lines, rectangles, bitmaps
and 
color changes.  In a program's source code, you first make a sprite.  Then, 
you insert a pointer to it.

You can create an icon on your personal menu or in any document by placing a 
sprite with a payload of [C:/Doc/HolyC.TXT.Z,1] HolyC code to execute.  This
is a called "sprite 
macro".  If you check "Pop-Up", it will spawn a new task and run the payload.
 
If you have it on your personal menu, you can, optionally, check "Esc" and it 
will exit to the cmd-line shell and print the macro similar to how the Linux 
history works.
