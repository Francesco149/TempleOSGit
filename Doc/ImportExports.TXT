[C:/Doc/Glossary.TXT,1] JIT Compile Mode makes use of the current task's hash
sym table and its parent 
tasks' tables.  It fetches syms from parent tasks' tables if not found
locally 
in the current task's table and it places new syms in the current task's 
table.  Conceptually, syms are at the scope of environment vars in other 
operating systems.

[C:/Doc/Glossary.TXT,1] AOT Compile Mode creates a new, empty, sym table
which you must populate by #i
ncludeing [C:/Kernel/AOT.HPP,1] or whatever to import syms.

When a sym is placed into a table, older syms with identical names will be 
overshadowed if they exist.  Duplicates are not allowed in many cases, 
especially in asm blks.  Dupicates are allowed, by design in other cases, so 
that you can repeatedly #include the same file from the cmd line while 
developing it.  Or, so you can repeatedly declare a function with a standard 
name, like "UpdateWin()".  This case might occur when the adam task is 
starting-up loading-in many little utilities.

extern binds a new [C:/TempleOS/Kernel/Adam1a.HPP.Z,707] HTT_FUN or
[C:/TempleOS/Kernel/Adam1a.HPP.Z,704] HTT_GLBL_VAR sym to an existing sym of
the same 
name if it exists in the sym table (just in just-in-time code).  It also can 
be used to generate a fwd reference.

import binds a new [C:/TempleOS/Kernel/Adam1a.HPP.Z,707] HTT_FUN or
[C:/TempleOS/Kernel/Adam1a.HPP.Z,704] HTT_GLBL_VAR sym to a sym of the same
name 
imported from the task's sym table at [C:/TempleOS/Kernel/Hash1a.CPP.Z,733]
Load() time.  If no sym exists to bind 
to at [C:/TempleOS/Kernel/Hash1a.CPP.Z,733] Load() time, the code using this
sym will be left incomplete until the 
sym is defined.


_extern binds a new [C:/TempleOS/Kernel/Adam1a.HPP.Z,707] HTT_FUN or
[C:/TempleOS/Kernel/Adam1a.HPP.Z,704] HTT_GLBL_VAR sym to an existing sym, of
a **diffe
rent** name.  It must exists in the sym table.  Basically, this binds C to
asm.

_import binds a new [C:/TempleOS/Kernel/Adam1a.HPP.Z,707] HTT_FUN or
[C:/TempleOS/Kernel/Adam1a.HPP.Z,704] HTT_GLBL_VAR sym to a sym, of a
**different** name 
imported from the task's sym table at [C:/TempleOS/Kernel/Hash1a.CPP.Z,733]
Load() time.  If no sym exists to bind 
to at [C:/TempleOS/Kernel/Hash1a.CPP.Z,733] Load() time, the code using this
sym will be left incomplete until the 
sym is defined.  Basically, this binds C to asm from elsewhere.

* GoTo labels must not have the same name as global scope objects.  GoTo's
are 
rare and I don't want to slow the compiler and add code to fix this.  You
will 
get errors if a collision happens, so it's not very dangerous, but the error 
message is baffling.

* The member names "pad and "reserved" are special because multiple instances 
with the same name are allowed in a class.

* Use reg or noreg in front of local var names to override automatic reg var 
allocation.  You can, optionally, specify a reg after the "reg" keyword.
 
* Local non-reg function vars can be accessed in asm blks with &i[RBP] for 
example.

* Glbl vars and functions can be accessed in asm with and & as in
	MOV	RAX,I64 [&glbl_var]
	CALL	I32 &Fun
	CALL	I32 &SYS_SYM

* In JIT asm code, &SYS_SYM and &Fun don't need IMPORT.

* All offspring tasks of a task inherit syms.

* The sizeof() and HolyC structure members can be used in asm blks.

* No reg vars are used in functions with a try/catch.  They will be force to n
oreg.

* Using &i or i.u8[2] on a local var, i, will force it to noreg.

* An unused gap on the stk is left for reg vars.

* Note: static function vars do not go on the data heap, no matter the
setting 
of the [C:/TempleOS/Kernel/Adam1a.HPP.Z,1587] OPTf_GLBLS_ON_DATA_HEAP.  They
may in the future.

* [C:/TempleOS/Kernel/Adam1a.HPP.Z,1583] OPTf_EXTERNS_TO_IMPORTS will treat
_extern as _import and extern as import.  
This allows a header to be used either as a JIT compiled or AOT compiled 
header.
