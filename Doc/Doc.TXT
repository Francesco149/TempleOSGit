A TempleOS document is a [Data Types/Circular Queue,1] Circular Queue of cmds
and graphics.  See 
[C:/Doc/Dollar.TXT.Z,1] Dollar Cmds and [C:/Adam/Doc/DocInit.CPP.Z,13]
ST_DOC_CMDS.  See [C:/Kernel/Adam1a.HPP.Z,1226] CDocEntry for the entry
structure.  See 
[C:/Adam/Training.CPP.Z,200] TipOfDay() for a nice example.

There is one document format for the editor/ viewer/ browser/ cmd line.

There is one [C:/Kernel/Adam1a.HPP.Z,1401] CDoc for the border, and a pair
for double buffering.  See
