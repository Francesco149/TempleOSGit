A TempleOS document is a [Data Types/Circular Queue,1] Circular Queue of cmds
and graphics.  See 
[C:/Doc/Dollar.TXT,1] Dollar Cmds and [C:/TempleOS/Adam/Doc/Doc.CPP.Z,29]
ST_DOC_CMDS.  See [C:/TempleOS/Kernel/Adam1a.HPP.Z,1334] CDocEntry for the
entry structure.  See 
[C:/TempleOS/Adam/Training.CPP.Z,203] TipOfDay() for a nice example.

There is one document format for the editor/ viewer/ browser/ cmd line.

There is one [C:/TempleOS/Kernel/Adam1a.HPP.Z,1509] CDoc for the border, and
a pair for double buffering.  See 
[C:/Demo/Spy.CPP,1].
