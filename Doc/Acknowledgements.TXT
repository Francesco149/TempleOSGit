1) The font, [C:/Kernel/Font8x8.CPP,1], is taken from FreeDOS.

2) [C:/Kernel/Dsk/ATADef.HPP,1] originally
from Linux.  I later got the spec.

3) The heap algorithm, [C:/Kernel/Mem1b.CPP,1], is adapted from one I saw at 
Ticketmaster when I worked on their VAX operating system.

4) The LZW compression algorithm, [C:/Kernel/Compress.CPP,1], came from a
magazine 
and I implemented it when I worked for Ticketmaster.

5) The adaptive-step-size-Runge-Kutta algorithm, [C:/Adam/MathODE.CPP,1], is 
adapted from the book, _Numeric Recipies in C_.

6) The random number generator is from the book, _Numeric Recipies in C_.

7) Tne sheep and goats in AfterEgypt are from 
http://www.public-domain-photos.com.

8) The FAT32 file system is owned by MicroSoft.

9) A few features were inspired by MATLAB, such as ans in expressions at the 
command-line.  There is a lot of MSDOS , Windows, VAXTMOS (VAX Ticketmaster 
O.S.) and Unix inspiration, too, such as drive letters, command names, etc.

10) I included [C:/Misc/PCIDevices.TXT,1] PCIDevice Lst File.

11) Thanks to whoever wrote this CppHtml.CPP.Z.  I'm a novice on web stuff
and 
you helped me with html.  See [C:/Adam/Utils/ToHtml.CPP,1] ToHtml.

12) I used MagicISO to burn test CD's to help me understand the ISO9660 file 
system format.  I mostly used the ISO9660 spec.

13) I looked at bootable CD boot sects, but didn't learn anything, finding it 
easier to make my own.

14) I think I got my original PC speaker code from Borland C.

15) I found PS/2 keyboard and mouse code on the net and documentation.  My 
code is very different.  I found VGA reg info on the net.

16) Thanks to http://www.osdev.org for a couple tips.

17) God told me to stick with 640x480 16 color,  a single audio voice and
kept 
me from zombie-walking into making child windows like Windows.  Instead, I 
made one window per task with no child windows.  He also guided my progress, 
very obviously.

18) I got Webster's Dictionary and The King James Bible from 
Project Gutenberg.

In short, I wrote every one of the 129,664 lines myself, no GPL code, no 
linkage or dependence on other code.  Anyone who says otherwise is being an 
ass.
