I, Terry A. Davis, wrote all 121,479 lines of TempleOS over the past 17.3 
years (full-time).  It can run on some bare metal 64-bit PC's from about 
2005-2010 with no layering, libraries, tools, modules or anything from other 
sources.  Otherwise, you run it in a virtual machine, like VMware, QEMU or Vir
tualBox.  It is independent and stands alone.  It has no networking, so it 
certainly doesn't call home.  100% of the src code is including on all 
distro's, from the kernel to the compiler to the boot loaders!  It is public 
domain, not GPL.

*) [C:/Kernel/FontStd.CPP.Z,1], is taken from FreeDOS.  It's public domain.

*) [C:/Kernel/FontCyrillic.CPP.Z,1], is taken from OrientDisplay without
permission.

*) [C:/Kernel/KernelA.HPP.Z,2258] ATA Reg and Cmd Definitions are originally
from Linux.  Later, I got the 
spec.

*) The heap algorithm, [C:/Kernel/Mem/MAllocFree.CPP.Z,1], is adapted from
one I saw 
at Ticketmaster when I worked on their VAX operating system.

*) The LZW compression algorithm, [C:/Kernel/Compress.CPP.Z,1], came from a
magazine 
and I implemented it when I worked for Ticketmaster.

*) The adaptive-step-size-Runge-Kutta algorithm, [C:/Adam/AMathODE.CPP.Z,1],
is 
adapted from the book, _Numeric Recipies in C_.

*) The mountain, palm trees, sheep and goats in AfterEgypt are from 
http://www.public-domain-photos.com.  The wolf in BlackDiamond is also from 
there.  I took watermarked photos and converted to 16 color.

*) The FAT32 file system is owned by MicroSoft.

*) A few features were inspired by MATLAB, such as ans in expressions at the 
command-line.  There is a lot of MSDOS , Windows, VAXTMOS (VAX Ticketmaster 
O.S.) and Unix inspiration, too, such as drive letters, command names, etc.

*) I included [C:/Misc/PCIDevices.TXT.Z,1] PCIDevice Lst File.

*) Thanks to whoever wrote this CppHtml.CPP.Z.  I'm a novice on web stuff and 
you helped me with html.  See [C:/Demo/ToHtmlToTXTDemo/ToHtml.CPP.Z,1].

*) I used MagicISO to burn test CD's to help me understand the ISO9660 file 
system format.  I mostly used the ISO9660 spec.

*) I looked at bootable CD boot sects, but didn't learn anything, finding it 
easier to make my own.

*) I think I got my original PC speaker code from Borland C.

*) I found PS/2 keyboard and mouse code on the net and documentation.  My
code 
is very different.  I found VGA reg info on the net.

*) Thanks to http://www.osdev.org for a couple tips.

*) God told me to stick with 640x480 16 color,  a single audio voice and kept 
me from zombie-walking into making child windows like Windows.  Instead, I 
made one window per task with no child windows.  He also guided my progress, 
very obviously.

*) I got Webster's Dictionary and The King James Bible from Project Gutenberg.

*) John Carmack inspired me to use "[C:/Kernel/KMathB.CPP.Z,1] Clamp" as a
name instead of "Limit".  He 
inspired me to use "needle" and "haystack" as names.  He inspired me to 
simplify my Frames-Per-Second code.

*) Bill Gates inspired me to add comments to my [C:/Doc/HelpIndex.TXT.Z,1]
Help & Index.

*) I hired an artist, Cody Rigby, for $3,000 worth of pixel art.

*) Erik van der Karbargenbok made [C:/Linux/TempleBot,1] TempleBot.

*) The random number generator is from Donald Knuth in the wikipedia entry
for 
Linear_congruential_generator.
