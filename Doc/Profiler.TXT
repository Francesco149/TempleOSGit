The profiler records where the CPU was executing when the 1000 Hz timer 
interrupt occured, so you can learn where time is spent.

Use the [C:/Adam/Utils/Profiler.CPP.Z,27] Prof() depth argument to record a
hit in the N routines which called 
the current routine, as well.

When done collecting statistics, use [C:/Adam/Utils/Profiler.CPP.Z,57]
ProfRep() for a report.  You might need a 
[C:/Adam/DolDoc/DocNew.CPP.Z,610] DocMax() to expand the command line window
buffer to fit it all.

Study the code.  The profiler is very simple.  You might want to enhance it
or 
modify it to debug something in particular.
