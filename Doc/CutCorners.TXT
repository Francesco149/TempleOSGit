                                 Cut Corners

There are a few places where I cut corners in the interest of not junking-up 
code.  This is part of the TempleOS mentality.  I try not to let stupid
legacy 
compatibility issues enter and junk-up TempleOS.

* I made my type-casting operator post-fix because it makes the compiler way 
cleaner.

* TempleOS does not figure-out FAT32 short name alias numbers. 
[C:/Kernel/Dsk/FileSysFAT.CPP.Z,575] FAT32DirNew(). 
 It can cause hard drive corruption, so I might have to do it.  It would 
really take a lot of junky code for this hatefully, detestable, legacy issue.
 
"Please don't make me ruin my beautiful shiny-new TempleOS with that!"  I am 
also not enthused about FAT32 because it is in patent limbo.  FAT32 might get 
removed from TempleOS.  There is the [C:/Doc/RedSea.TXT.Z,1] RedSea  64-bit
file system that works 
perfectly well.  FAT32 is useful, however, because it assists in transferring 
between dual booted operating systems.

* I changed the [C:/Compiler/OpCodes.TXT.Z,1] asm opcodes names to remove the
ambiguity between instructions 
with different numbers of arguments, making my [C:/Compiler/Asm.CPP.Z,1]
assembler simpler and I did 
minimal 16-bit asm support, since 64-bit is what you should be using, unless 
you're doing a [C:/Adam/Boot/BootCD.CPP.Z,1] boot loader.

* There are no file-sharing locks of any kind.  You're on your own.

* A hidden window is never refreshed.  Certain tasks are never done, 
therefore.  During refresh, the entry count limit of the document buffer is, 
normally, checked and enforced.  If you print to the command-line in a task 
whose window is covered, no limit on buffer exists and it will alloc memory 
for the document buffer until the system runs out of memory and crashes.
