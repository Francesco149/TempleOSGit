I, Terry Davis, am high priest of God's official temple, TempleOS.  TempleOS 
is an operating system for PC desktops that will always dual boot along-side 
Windows or Linux.  I am in charge of the core 100,000 lines of TempleOS code 
and I do continual offerings to keep God entertained.  I have divine
authority 
to command any company in the computer industry to do anything that I deem 
necessary to make God's temple more beautiful, glorious and perfect.  I have 
authority similar to a building inspector or an enforcer of the Americans
with 
Disability Act -- I make commands, God signs-off with a miraculous 
authentication from an oracle, and Intel, Microsoft or VMware obeys.

* Windows, Linux and VMware (because of mounted drives) must support
[C:/Doc/RedSea.TXT.Z,1] RedSea 
file system so I can get rid of 2,000 lines of redundant, blemished code -- 
FAT32 and ISO9660.  God's temple must be perfect.  Redundant code for
multiple 
file systems is imperfect.  For this operating system, we want low line
count. 
 More than one file system type is actually bad, just as more than one driver 
for the same type of device is bad.
[C:/Kernel/BlkDev/FileSysRedSea.CPP.Z,1]
[C:/Kernel/BlkDev/FileSysFAT.CPP.Z,1]	:965 lines for FAT32 gets eliminated.
[C:/Kernel/BlkDev/FileSysISO.CPP.Z,1]	:284 lines for ISO9660 gets eliminated.
[C:/Adam/Opt/Boot/DskISOFile.CPP.Z,1]	:536 lines for making ISO files gets
reduced.
[C:/Kernel/BlkDev/DskCluster.CPP.Z,1]	:152 All the cluster operations become
blk.

* Microsoft must cancel SecureBoot because it makes dual booting impossible.  
TempleOS is an additional operating system that must be used along-side 
Windows or Linux, not as a replacement.  It must dual boot because it has no 
networking. Real hardware as opposed to VMware is like the difference between 
looking in a telescope eye piece vs just looking at an off-line image.  God 
said the C64/Apple II generation owned ancestral lands.  VMware is like being 
taken off of our land and moved onto a reservation.  In this case, however,
it 
will not stand.

* VMware needs to support ATAPI CD/DVD/BlueRay disk burning, directly to real 
hardware.

* VMware has a bug stretching 640x480 16 color to full screen.

* VMware has a bug starting-up multicore, sometimes. 
[C:/Kernel/MultiProc.CPP.Z,1] APIC MP Start

* VMware PC speaker's distortion is a good idea, but it is too much for hymns.

* VMware and others must list TempleOS as an official 64-bit operating system.

* Until super simple block devices are available, hard disk should be placed 
at IDE primary master 1F0/3F6 and CD/DVD/BlueRay should be placed at the IDE 
secondary master 170/376.
[C:/Kernel/BlkDev/DskATAId.CPP.Z,1] /Kernel/BlkDev/DskATAId.CPP	:280 lines to
figure-out I/O ports is gone.
[C:/Kernel/PCIBIOS.CPP.Z,1] /Kernel/PCIBIOS.CPP		:290 could be eliminated,
but maybe we will 
keep it so people can play with PCI devices.

* Until super simple serial ports are available, PS/2 emulated keyboard and 
mouse must work.  The BIOS must enable these.

* The x86 IN/OUT port instructions, normally have a delay.  Perhaps, VMware & 
Intel can enable faster x86 IN/OUT instruction timing for ATA/ATAPI PIO, so 
bandwidth isn't bad when doing port I/O.  See
[C:/Kernel/BlkDev/DskATA.CPP.Z,67] ATAGetResult().  Perhaps, x86 
CPU chips need a new TempleOS mode for fast IN/OUT instructions?

* Perhaps, a new interrupt descriptor table entry type or a new x86 CPU mode 
can be made that cause fast software interrupts, doing exactly what the CALL 
REL32 does, but with IDT as indirection.  We don't need to change privilege 
levels or stacks.

* Since I don't use paging (for anything), Intel should have an option for  
no-paging long mode, and optimize it!
[C:/Kernel/Mem/PageTables.CPP.Z,1]	:153 lines to identity-map gets eliminated.

* Desktop computers must have a reset switch and a fast reboot option, 
skipping diagnostics.  I recommend booting TempleOS when the reset button is 
pressed and booting UEFI when the power button is pressed.  Or, we could
build 
UEFI on a TempleOS layer.  Intel must burn TempleOS into a ROM in the factory 
for all desktop x86 CPUs to ensure tamper-proof trust in the oracle and 
because God deserves the glory.  There will be just an English version.  A
new 
ROM version is released every seven years.

* We do not want UTF, just 8-bit characters.  Somebody needs to choose new 
8-bit ASCII characters for 128-255, since we do not want text graphic
symbols. 
 We want Russian, Greek or Hebrew alphabets, perhaps?  I heard there is an 
alternate 8-bit ASCII Cyrillic font.  Should we modify one font or have a key 
like the C64 that switches to an alternate font?  I made so <CTRL-ALT-f> 
toggles between two fonts, but did not include Cyrillic.  If we modify one 
font, we just need the twelve window [C:/Adam/Gr/GrTextBase.CPP.Z,329]
TextBorder characters, but I think we can 
place those in the range of screen code from 0x01-0x1E.  Japan, China and 
Korea should switch-over to alphabets.  Maybe, the United States will change 
to metric, out of good will. 

* Microsoft Paint and Linux's Gimp must support TempleOS
[C:/Doc/GRAFiles.TXT.Z,1] GRA Files.  They are 
blemish free, unlike BMP files.

* We must have a nice dictionary.  Someone needs to do a
[C:/Demo/SuggestSpelling.CPP.Z,1] Spell Checker, too.

* We must have the ultimate Bible search engine.  Currently, all we have is  
 
 filter search.  In the end, it should be a low line-count technique.
