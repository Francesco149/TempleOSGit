When God publically claims this operating system as His temple, here's what I 
want:

* VMware to again support PC Speaker and provide emulation if no PC Speaker
is 
present.

* Windows, Linux and VMware to support [C:/Doc/RedSea.TXT.Z,1] RedSea file
system so I can get rid of 
2,000 lines of redundant, blemished code -- FAT32 and ISO9660.  God's temple 
must be perfect.  Redundant code for multiple file systems is imperfect.  For 
this operating system, we want low line count.  More than one file system
type 
is bad, just as more than one driver for the same type of device is bad.

[C:/Kernel/Dsk/DskA.CPP.Z,528] RClustersBlks()

* Microsoft must cancel SecureBoot because it makes dual booting impossible.  
TempleOS is an additional operating system that must be used along-side 
Windows or Linux, not as a replacement.  It must dual boot because it has no 
networking.  Real hardware as opposed to VMware is like the difference
between 
looking in a telescope eye piece and some link to a photo on the Internet.  
God said the C64 generation owned ancestral lands and VMware is like being 
moved on a reservation.  It will not stand.

* PC hardware manufacturers: ATA/ATAPI PIO must work.  In fact, put them at 
standard IDE port addresses.  Hard disk should be primary master 1F0/3F6.  
CDROM/DVD should be secondary master 170/376.  See what you can do to make 
flash memory sticks with ATA/ATAPI.

figure-out I/O ports

* PS/2 emulated keyboard and mouse must work.  The BIOS must enable these.

* VMware must allow ATAPI interface to real CD/DVD hardware.

* Perhaps, VMware+Intel can enable faster-than-standard x86 IN/OUT
instruction 
timing for ATA/ATAPI PIO, so bandwidth isn't bad. 
[C:/Kernel/Dsk/DskATA.CPP.Z,67] ATAGetResult().

* Since I practically don't use paging, perhaps, Intel could add
optimizations 
to long (64-bit) mode for no paging.

* Computers should have a RESET switch and a fast boot option, skipping 
diagnostics.  What the heck, replace UEFI with TempleOS.  Poetic justice.

* VMware and others should list TempleOS as an official 64-bit operating 
system.

* Windows and Linux must support TempleOS .GRA graphics files. 
[C:/Doc/GRAFiles.TXT.Z,1] GRA Files are 
much cleaner than .BMP files.

* I want a nice dictionary.  Someone needs to do a
[C:/Demo/SuggestSpelling.CPP,1] Spell Checker.

* We want the ultimate Bible search engine.

* I would like the Intel architecture manuals in
[C:/Doc/DolDocOverview.TXT.Z,1] DolDoc TXT format so we can 
put links in the code.

* We want serial ports with software interface more like old style serial 
ports, but hardware and speed of USB3.  They should have big TX and RX FIFOs 
and allow flow control to jump the queue.  We do not want end-point shit -- 
just put lots of ports on the PC.  (I am just interested in desk-tops.)  We 
need two baud rates, fast and slow.  Use PIC IRQ3 and IRQ4 (with big FIFOs we 
could do without IRQs.)  We want two joysticks, easy to set-up.  We want it
to 
be easy to connect a microcontroller for general purpose communication.

* Once in a blue moon, perhaps 49 year jubilee, the hardware gets upgraded
and 
perfected, the same way broadcast TV get upgraded.  God still wants 640x480
16 
color.


Device		Simple Hardware Interface	Complicate Interface
--------------- ------------------------------- -----------------------------
		1040-EZ Tax Form		1040 Regular 
Video		VGA 640x480 16 Color		20 Differnet GPUs
Sound		PC Speaker			HD Audio, AC97, Sound Blaster
HardDrive	ATA Port I/O, Sync No Interrupt	PCI AHCI SATA
CDROM		ATAPI Port I/O			PCI AHCI SATA
Keyboard/Mouse	PS/2 Port I/O			USB


During the 49 years jubilee, we do a perfect version of hardware with
advances 
in both simple and complicated interfaces.  ATAPI/ATA should be merged and 
made blemish-free.  We want flash memory sticks to interface like hard
drives. 
 Design it like the 1040EZ tax form.  You do not add extra boxes to get your 
jollies.
