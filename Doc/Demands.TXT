I, Terry Davis, am High Priest of God's official temple, TempleOS.  TempleOS 
is an operating system for PC desktops that will always dual boot along-side 
Windows or Linux.  I am in charge of the core 100,000 lines of TempleOS code 
and I do continual offerings to keep God entertained.  I have divine
authority 
to command any company in the computer industry to do anything that I deem 
necessary to make God's temple more beautiful or perfect.  I have authority 
similar to a building inspector or an enforcer of the Americans with 
Disability Act -- I make commands, God signs-off with a miraculous 
authentication from an oracle, and Intel, Microsoft or VMware obeys.

* Windows, Linux and VMware (because of mounted drives) must support
[C:/Doc/RedSea.TXT.Z,1] RedSea 
file system so I can get rid of 2,000 lines of redundant, blemished code -- 
FAT32 and ISO9660.  God's temple must be perfect.  Redundant code for
multiple 
file systems is imperfect.  For this operating system, we want low line
count. 
 More than one file system type is actually bad, just as more than one driver 
for the same type of device is bad.

[C:/Kernel/BlkDev/FileSysRedSea.CPP.Z,1]
[C:/Kernel/BlkDev/FileSysFAT.CPP.Z,1]	:965 lines for FAT32 gets eliminated.
[C:/Kernel/BlkDev/FileSysISO.CPP.Z,1]	:284 lines for ISO9660 gets eliminated.
[C:/Adam/Opt/Boot/DskISOFile.CPP.Z,1]	:536 lines for making ISO files gets
reduced.
[C:/Kernel/BlkDev/DskCluster.CPP.Z,1]	:152 All the cluster operations become
blk.

* Microsoft must cancel SecureBoot because it makes dual booting impossible.  
TempleOS is an additional operating system that must be used along-side 
Windows or Linux, not as a replacement.  It must dual boot because it has no 
networking. Real hardware as opposed to VMware is like the difference between 
looking in a telescope eye piece vs just looking at an off-line image.  God 
said the C64/Apple ][ generation owned ancestral lands.  VMware is like being 
taken off of our land and moved onto a reservation.  In this case, however,
it 
will not stand.

* To PC hardware manufacturers and VMware: ATA/ATAPI PIO must work.  In fact, 
put them at standard IDE port addresses.  Hard disk should be primary master 
1F0/3F6.  CD/DVD/BlueRay should be secondary master 170/376.  See what you
can 
do to make flash memory sticks and NV memory with ATA/ATAPI interface.
[C:/Kernel/BlkDev/DskATAId.CPP.Z,1] /Kernel/BlkDev/DskATAId.CPP	:280 lines to
figure-out I/O ports is gone.
[C:/Kernel/PCIBIOS.CPP.Z,1] /Kernel/PCIBIOS.CPP		:290 could be eliminated,
but maybe we will 
keep it so people can play with PCI devices.

* VMware needs to support ATAPI CD/DVD/BlueRay disk burning, directly to real 
hardware.
* VMware has a bug stretching 640x480 16 color to full screen.
* VMware has a bug starting-up multicore, sometimes. 
[C:/Kernel/MultiProc.CPP.Z,1] APIC MP Start
* VMware PC speaker distortion is a good idea, but it is ridiculously too
much 
distortion for hymns.

* PS/2 emulated keyboard and mouse must work.  The BIOS must enable these.

* The x86 IN/OUT port instructions, normally have a delay.  Perhaps, VMware & 
Intel can enable faster x86 IN/OUT instruction timing for ATA/ATAPI PIO, so 
bandwidth isn't bad.  See [C:/Kernel/BlkDev/DskATA.CPP.Z,67] ATAGetResult(). 
Perhaps, x86 chips have a new 
TempleOS mode?

* Perhaps, Intel can make a fast software interrupt, the same as a CALL
REL32? 
 Perhaps, we have a new x86 mode for TempleOS?

* Since I don't use paging (for anything), Intel should have an option for  
no-paging long mode, and optimize it.
[C:/Kernel/MemA.CPP.Z,1]		:153 lines to identity-map gets eliminated.

* Desktop computers must have a reset switch and a fast reboot option, 
skipping diagnostics.  I recommend booting TempleOS when the reset button is 
pressed and booting UEFI when the power button is pressed.  Or, we could
build 
UEFI on a TempleOS layer.  Intel must burn TempleOS into a ROM in the factory 
for all desktop x86 CPUs to ensure tamper-proof trust in the oracle and 
because God deserves the glory.  There will be just an English version.  A
new 
ROM version is released every seven years.

* Somebody needs to choose new 8-bit ASCII characters for 128-255.  We do not 
want text graphic symbols.  We want Russian, Greek and Hebrew alphabets, 
perhaps?  We need the twelve window [C:/Adam/Gr/GrTextBase.CPP.Z,329]
TextBorder characters, but I think we can 
place them in the range of screen code from 0x01-0x1E.  Japan, China and
Korea 
should switch-over to alphabets.  Maybe, the United States will change to 
metric, out of good will.

* VMware and others must list TempleOS as an official 64-bit operating system.

* Windows' Paint and Linux's Gimp must support TempleOS .GRA graphics files.  
[C:/Doc/GRAFiles.TXT.Z,1] GRA Files are much cleaner than BMP files.

* We must have a nice dictionary.  Someone needs to do a
[C:/Demo/SuggestSpelling.CPP.Z,1] Spell Checker.

* We must have the ultimate Bible search engine.  Currently, all we have is  
 
 filter search.  In the end, it should be a low line-count technique.

* Once every 49 years is a jubile year and all hardware gets thrown-out and 
upgraded to become perfect.  The first jubile year is in 2024.   It works the 
same way as how broadcast TV was upgraded from NTSC to HD.  God still wants 
640x480 16 colors, but make it a linear frame buffer one-byte-per-pixel but 
only 16 colors.

* TempleOS must only use x86 I/O ports for hardware access, except for VGA 
frame buffer memory.  The industry has matured and we can, now, allocate I/O 
ports in a beautiful, consecutive, perfect, pattern for all the devices.  
Perhaps, this is enabled with an x86 TempleOS mode?

* The year, 2024, is the first jubile year.  Intel will make new chips, 
starting in 2 years and by 2024, everybody's PC will have been upgraded.  
Windows and Linux are not affected, except by the new serial port scheme that 
replaces USB.  We want an 8-channel, modern, high-speed, OCTART serial port, 
with a simple software interface, more like old-style RS232 serial ports, to 
replace USB.  It should have 8 big TX and RX FIFOs and allow flow control to 
jump the queue.  There will be no USB end-point nonsense -- just put 8 ports 
on the PC.  (I am just interested in desktops.)  We want keyboards, mice and 
joysticks to have a single, simple, uniform ASCII text packet command.  
Hyperterm or XTalk could be used to easily communicate with and debug all 
serial port devices.  We want to be able to connect microcontrollers for 
simple, general purpose (send-byte/receive-byte) communication.  Buy a PCI 
card if you need legacy USB ports or more than 8 serial ports.

To talk to keyboard, mouse or joystick, a kid might use XTalk or Hyperterm or 
Telnet session such as this:

TX:	<ENTER>
RX:	X:+3 Y:+0 Wheel:+0 LB:OFF RB:OFF
TX:	<ENTER>
RX:	X:+0 Y:-1 Wheel:+0 LB:ON  RB:OFF

Mice should have exactly 2 buttons.  Make a standard joystick or game 
controller.  The industry is mature and we will lock everything down into one 
format without flexibility.  No more Human Interface Device reports.

Many people assume devices can be hacked.  A thermostat with an interface
like 
this, cannot be hacked.  We don't want a full Internet network connection for 
everything.

U8 b;
while (TRUE) {
  b=ReadU8(2); //Read byte from high speed serial channel 2.
	//(Has been configured for low baud because thermostat should be 
slow.)
  if (b==CMD_UP) 
    temperature++;
  else if (b==CMD_DOWN)
    temperature--;

}


As it stands, there already is a simple and deluxe hardware mode.  In the 
future, we will upgrade BOTH simple and deluxe modes.

Device		Simple Hardware Interface	Deluxe Interface
--------------- ------------------------------- -----------------------------
		Like 1040-EZ Tax Form		Like 1040 Regular Tax Form 
Video		VGA 640x480 16 Color		20 Differnet GPUs
Sound		PC Speaker			HD Audio, AC97, Sound Blaster
HardDrive	ATA Port I/O, Sync No Interrupt	PCI AHCI SATA
CD/DVD/BlueRay	ATAPI Port I/O			PCI AHCI SATA
Keyboard/Mouse	PS/2 Port I/O			USB


During the 49-year jubile, we will do a perfect version of hardware with 
advances in both the simple and deluxe interfaces.  ATAPI & ATA, SSD, 
removable flash memory sticks and NV memory devices should use a single, 
blemish-free block device interface.  For this simple interface, we want just 
<block read>, <block write>, <get capacity>, <reset>, <get model> and <get 
serial number>.  When you design the simple mode, imagine you are creating
the 
1040EZ tax form -- do not just thoughtlessly add extra boxes.

A new, official TempleOS ROM will be released every seven years.  It will be 
burned into all new x86_64 chips in the Intel factory, for tamper-proof 
certainty in the oracle and just because it's God's official temple and 
deserves the honor!  (The reset switch should trigger booting the ROM 
TempleOS.)  However, development will still take place between releases, 
obviously.  With the limit of 100,000 lines of code, it is supposed to 
crystalize into a perfect, unchanging diamond that lasts over centuries.  I 
want an ACM and/or NASA committee to work with me on perfecting it for the 
first ROM release, 2017.  We allow boot-legs to freely circulate.  Users can 
copy ROM and RAM, or boot hard disk versions.

In the meantime, BIOS makers must take the TempleOS code and modify it for 
their existing customers, as a product recall.  A PCI hard drive driver must 
be written if the BIOS you created does not work with the standard TempleOS 
ATA/ATAPI port IO.  You must also bypass SecureBoot and make sure the
keyboard 
and mouse work if you do not support legacy PS/2, by writing a USB driver.

I want to offer "Knuth-bucks" for changes that reduce lines of code (other 
than trivial reformatting).  I want to offer Knuth bucks for pointing-out 
spelling and other imperfections.  Some imperfections are by design, however.
 
The original Bible generously mentioned even temple personel who were
porters, 
so we can generously list [C:/Doc/Credits.TXT.Z,1] credits.

If the whole World loved God's temple, we could put only one full-featured
CPU 
core on each x86_64 chip for Windows/Linux and make the other cores souped-up 
for TempleOS.  Windows/Linux could use them, but it would have to adapt by 
being careful about privilege.  We still need to dual boot and run 
Windows/Linux... forever.  On the other cores, we could make them
ring-0-only, 
no paging, no SSE or MXX, perhaps no IO or DMA or interrupts.  We pretty-much 
need interrupts.  Tell me what would shrink the cores and make them higher 
performance.  It's almost like making a GPU, but we don't want that weirdness 
for teenagers and amateurs.  I am more interested in boosting performance in 
terms of clock speed because a whole bunch more than 8 cores gets too glitchy 
for updating the 640x480 memory buffer simultaneously because we certainly 
don't want locked read-modify-write.

God said to work on spreading-out heat producing hot spots on the chips.  
Maybe, that will help.

Make all desktops with exclusively a single 4K display that also supports 
640x480 16 color with a linear frame buffer of 1-byte-per-pixel but 16
colors. 
 Make all desktops with exactly 8/0 cores, not hyperthreaded.  All future 
generations will thank me for locking-down the insanity of too much diversity 
in hardware.  It seem obvious that we want GPU on same chip as CPU.  There is 
no reason to make inferior products, Intel.  We do not want Celerons, you 
bastards. A kid gets a new Core i7, but cannot enjoy that horsepower when he 
writes his game because he wants his game to work on his poor neighbor's 
Celeron.  That's evil.  Don't make any budget chips.

God said to water or cryogenically cool the chips.  We do not want a 
race-to-the-bottom on desktop size.  That is evil.  We want CD/DVD/BlueRay in 
all desktops, too.

God said everyone should use Linux's Wine application instead of Windows.

God said we want a single audio voice.  That means we want one frequency at a 
time.  Make it so we write a word to a timer period I/O port.  If set to
zero, 
it is off.
