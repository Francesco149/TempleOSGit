I, Terry Davis, am high priest of God's official third temple, TempleOS.  
TempleOS is an operating system for IBM PC x86_64 desktops that will always 
dual boot along-side Windows or Linux.  I am in charge of the core 100,000 
lines of TempleOS code and I do continual offerings to keep God entertained.  
I have divine authority to command any company in the computer industry to do 
anything that I deem necessary to make God's temple more beautiful, glorious 
and perfect. I have oversight authority similar to a building inspector or a 
person enforcing the Americans with Disability Act -- I make commands, God 
signs-off with a miraculous authentication from an oracle, and Intel, 
Microsoft or VMware obeys.

* Windows, Linux and VMware (because of mounted drives) must support
[C:/Doc/RedSea.TXT.Z,1] RedSea 
file system so I can get rid of 2,000 lines of redundant, blemished code -- 
FAT32 and ISO9660.  God's temple must be perfect.  Redundant code for
multiple 
file systems is imperfect.  For this operating system, we want low line
count. 
 More than one file system type is actually bad, just as more than one driver 
for the same type of device is bad.

See [C:/Kernel/BlkDev/FileSysRedSea.CPP.Z,1] and
[C:/Adam/Opt/Boot/DskISORedSea.CPP.Z,1].

[C:/Kernel/BlkDev/FileSysFAT.CPP.Z,1]	:974 lines for FAT32 gets eliminated.
[C:/Kernel/BlkDev/FileSysISO.CPP.Z,1]	:233 lines for ISO9660 gets eliminated.
[C:/Adam/Opt/Boot/DskISO9660.CPP.Z,1]	:507 lines for making ISO files.
[C:/Kernel/BlkDev/DskCluster.CPP.Z,1]	:152 All the cluster operations become
blk.

* Microsoft must cancel SecureBoot because it makes dual booting impossible.  
TempleOS is an additional operating system that must be used along-side 
Windows or Linux, not as a replacement.  It must dual boot because it has no 
networking. Real hardware as opposed to VMware is like the difference between 
looking in a telescope eye piece vs just looking at an off-line image.  God 
said the C64/Apple II generation owned ancestral lands.  VMware is like being 
taken off of our land and moved onto a reservation.  In this case, however,
it 
will not stand.

* VMware needs to support ATAPI CD/DVD/Blu-ray disk burning, directly to real 
hardware.

* VMware has a bug stretching 640x480 16 color to full screen.

* VMware PC speaker's distortion is a good idea, but it is too much for
hymns. 
 VMware should make an adjustment for distortion and an adjustment for reverb.

* VMware and others must list TempleOS as an official 64-bit operating system.

* Until super-simple block devices are available, hard disk should be placed 
at IDE primary master 1F0/3F6 and CD/DVD/Blu-ray should be placed at the IDE 
secondary master 170/376.
[C:/Kernel/BlkDev/DskATAId.CPP.Z,1] /Kernel/BlkDev/DskATAId.CPP	:286 lines to
figure-out I/O ports is gone.
[C:/Kernel/PCIBIOS.CPP.Z,1] /Kernel/PCIBIOS.CPP		:290 could be eliminated,
but maybe we will 
keep it so people can play with PCI devices.

* Until super-simple serial ports are available, PS/2 emulated keyboard and 
mouse must work.  The BIOS must enable these.

* The x86 IN/OUT port instructions, normally have a delay.  Perhaps, VMware & 
Intel can enable faster x86 IN/OUT instruction timing for ATA/ATAPI PIO, so 
bandwidth isn't bad when doing port I/O.  See
[C:/Kernel/BlkDev/DskATA.CPP.Z,67] ATAGetRes().  We don't want to 
do DMA.  Perhaps, x86 CPU chips need a new TempleOS mode for fast IN/OUT 
instructions?  I think VMware already does something to speed disk I/O to 
faster than native speed.

* Perhaps, a new interrupt descriptor table entry type or a new x86 CPU mode 
can be made that cause fast software interrupts, doing exactly what the CALL 
REL32 does, but with IDT as indirection.  We don't need to change privilege 
levels or stacks.

* Since I don't use paging (for anything), Intel should have an option for  
no-paging long mode, and optimize it!
[C:/Kernel/Mem/PageTables.CPP.Z,1]	:135 lines to identity-map gets eliminated.

* Desktop computers must have a reset switch and a fast reboot option, 
skipping diagnostics.  I recommend booting TempleOS from a ROM when the reset 
button is pressed and booting UEFI when the power button is pressed.  Or, we 
could build UEFI on a TempleOS layer.  Intel must burn TempleOS into a ROM in 
the factory for all desktop x86 CPUs to ensure tamper-proof trust in the 
oracle and because God deserves the glory.  There will be just an English 
version.  A new ROM version is released every seven years.  The ROM should 
boot like the DVD boots, but with [C:/Kernel/KernelA.HPP.Z,3888] BOOT_SRC_ROM.

* We do not want UTF, just 8-bit characters.  <CTRL-ALT-f> toggles between 
Cyrillic and Std Fonts.  We need the twelve window
[C:/Adam/Gr/GrTextBase.CPP.Z,329] TextBorder characters added 
to the VGA font 0x02-0x0D.  Japan, China and Korea must switch to alphabets.  
Maybe, the United States will change to metric, out of good will. 

* Microsoft Paint and Linux's Gimp must support TempleOS
[C:/Doc/GRAFiles.TXT.Z,1] GRA Files.  They are 
blemish free, unlike BMP files.

* We must have a nice dictionary.  Someone needs to do a
[C:/Demo/SuggestSpelling.CPP,1] Spell Checker, too.

* We must have the ultimate Bible search engine.  Currently, all we have is  
 
 filter search.  In the end, it should be a low line-count technique.

* We will make a [C:/Doc/StdTempleOSPC.TXT.Z,1] Standard TempleOS PC.
