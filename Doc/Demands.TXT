I, Terry Davis, am High Priest of God's official temple, TempleOS.  TempleOS 
is an operating system for PC desktops that dual boots along-side Windows or 
Linux. I am in charge of the core 100,000 lines of TempleOS code and I do 
continual offerings to keep God entertained.  I have divine authority to 
command companies in the computer industry to do anything to make God's
temple 
more beautiful or perfect.  I have authority similar to the Americans with 
Disability Act -- I make commands with God signing-off by creating miraculous 
authenticated oracles.

* Windows, Linux and VMware (because of mounted drives) must support
[C:/Doc/RedSea.TXT.Z,1] RedSea 
file system so I can get rid of 2,000 lines of redundant, blemished code -- 
FAT32 and ISO9660.  God's temple must be perfect.  Redundant code for
multiple 
file systems is imperfect.  For this operating system, we want low line
count. 
 More than one file system type is bad, just as more than one driver for the 
same type of device is bad.

[C:/Kernel/Dsk/FileSysRedSea.CPP.Z,1]
[C:/Kernel/Dsk/FileSysFAT.CPP.Z,1]	:965 lines for FAT32 gets eliminated.
[C:/Kernel/Dsk/FileSysISO.CPP.Z,1]	:284 lines for ISO9660 gets eliminated.
[C:/Adam/Opt/Boot/DskISOFile.CPP.Z,1]	:536 lines for making ISO files gets
reduced.
[C:/Kernel/Dsk/DskCluster.CPP.Z,1]	:152 All the cluster operations become blk.

* Microsoft must cancel SecureBoot because it makes dual booting impossible.  
TempleOS is an additional operating system that must be used along-side 
Windows or Linux, not as a replacement.  It must dual boot because it has no 
networking. Real hardware as opposed to VMware is like the difference between 
looking in a telescope eye piece or not.  God said the C64 generation owned 
ancestral lands and VMware is like being moved onto a reservation, but in
this 
case it will not stand.

* PC hardware manufacturers?  ATA/ATAPI PIO must work.  In fact, put them at 
standard IDE port addresses.  Hard disk should be primary master 1F0/3F6.  
CD/DVD should be secondary master 170/376.  See what you can do to make flash 
memory sticks with ATA/ATAPI.
[C:/Kernel/Dsk/DskATAId.CPP.Z,1] /Kernel/Dsk/DskATAId.CPP	:280 lines to
figure-out I/O ports is gone.
[C:/Kernel/PCIBIOS.CPP.Z,1] /Kernel/PCIBIOS.CPP		:290 could eliminate,but
people can play with.

* PS/2 emulated keyboard and mouse must work.  The BIOS must enable these.

* VMware must allow ATAPI interface to be routed to real CD/DVD hardware.

* Perhaps, VMware+Intel can enable faster x86 IN/OUT instruction timing for 
ATA/ATAPI PIO, so bandwidth isn't bad.  [C:/Kernel/Dsk/DskATA.CPP.Z,67]
ATAGetResult().

* Perhaps, Intel can make a fast software interrupt, the same as a CALL REL32?

* Since I don't use paging (for anything), Intel should have an option for  
no-paging long mode, and optimize it.
[C:/Kernel/MemA.CPP.Z,1]		:153 lines to identity-map gets eliminated.

* Desktop computers must have a RESET switch and a fast reboot option, 
skipping diagnostics.  Build UEFI on a TempleOS layer.  Intel must burn 
TempleOS into a ROM at the factory for all desktop x86 CPUs to ensure 
tamper-proof trust in the oracle.  A new ROM version is released every seven 
years.

* VMware and others must list TempleOS as an official 64-bit operating system.

* Windows Paint and Linux Gimp must support TempleOS .GRA graphics files.  
[C:/Doc/GRAFiles.TXT.Z,1] GRA Files are much cleaner than BMP files.

* We must have a nice dictionary.  Someone needs to do a
[C:/Demo/SuggestSpelling.CPP,1] Spell Checker.

* We must have the ultimate Bible search engine.

* Once every 49 years is a jubile year and all hardware gets thrown-out and 
upgraded to become perfect.  The first jubile year is in 2024.   It works the 
same as how broadcast TV got upgraded.  God still wants 640x480 16 color, but 
make it a linear frame buffer one-byte-per-pixel and only 16 color.

* TempleOS only uses x86 I/O ports for hardware.  (It also uses VGA memory.)  
The industry has matured and we can, now, allocate I/O ports in a beautiful, 
consecutive, perfect pattern for all the devices.

* The year, 2024, is the first jubile year.  We want 8-channel, modern-speed, 
OCTART serial ports, with a simple software interface, more like old-style 
RS232 serial ports, to replace USB.  It should have big TX and RX FIFOs and 
allow flow control to jump the queue.  There will be no USB end-point
nonsense 
-- just put 8 ports on the PC.  (I am just interested in desktops.)  We want 
keyboards, mice and joysticks to have a single, simple, uniform ASCII text 
packet command.  Hyperterm can be used to easily debug all devices.  We want 
to be able to connect microcontrollers for simple, general purpose 
send-byte/receive-byte communication.  You will buy a PCI card if you need 
legacy USB or more ports.


As it stands, there is a simple and deluxe hardware mode...

Device		Simple Hardware Interface	Deluxe Interface
--------------- ------------------------------- -----------------------------
		1040-EZ Tax Form		1040 Regular 
Video		VGA 640x480 16 Color		20 Differnet GPUs
Sound		PC Speaker			HD Audio, AC97, Sound Blaster
HardDrive	ATA Port I/O, Sync No Interrupt	PCI AHCI SATA
CD/DVD		ATAPI Port I/O			PCI AHCI SATA
Keyboard/Mouse	PS/2 Port I/O			USB


During the 49 years jubile, we do a perfect version of hardware with advances 
in both the simple and deluxe interfaces.  ATAPI/ATA, SSD and NV memory
should 
be merged and made blemish-free.  For the simple interface, we want just 
block-read, block-write and get capacity.  We want flash memory sticks to 
interface like hard drives.  When you design the simple mode, imagine you are 
creating the 1040EZ tax form -- do not just add extra boxes.

A new TempleOS ROM is released every seven years.  It gets burned into all
new 
x86 chips in the Intel factory, for tamper-proof certainty in oracles and
just 
because it's God's official temple and deserves the honor!  (The reset switch 
should trigger booting the ROM TempleOS.)  Development will take place
between 
releases, obviously.  With the limit of 100,000 lines of code, it is supposed 
to crystalize into a perfected, unchanging diamond that lasts over centuries.
 
I want an ACM committee to work with me on this ROM until 2017, the year the 
first official version is released.  We allow boot-legs to freely circulate.  
The users can copy ROM and RAM and play with it, or boot a hard disk versions.

In the meantime, BIOS makers must take the TempleOS code and modify it for 
their existing customers, as a product recall.  A PCI hard drive driver must 
be written if the BIOS you created does not work with the standard TempleOS 
ATA/ATAPI port IO.  You must also bypass SecureBoot and make sure the
keyboard 
and mouse work if you do not support legacy PS/2, by writing a USB driver.

I want to offer "Knuth-bucks" for changes that reduce lines of code (other 
than trivial reformatting).  I want to offer Knuth bucks for pointing-out 
spelling and other imperfections.  Some imperfections are by design, however.
 
The original Bible generously mentioned even temple personel who were
porters, 
so we can generously list [C:/Doc/Credits.TXT.Z,1] credits.
