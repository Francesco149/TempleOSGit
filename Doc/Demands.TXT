                                   Demands

When God publically claims this operating system as His official temple, here 
are my demands:

* VMware must again support PC Speaker and provide emulation if no PC Speaker 
is present.

* VMware must again support full screen 640x480 16 color mode. 

* Windows, Linux and VMware (because of mounted drives) must support
[C:/Doc/RedSea.TXT.Z,1] RedSea 
file system so I can get rid of 2,000 lines of redundant, blemished code -- 
FAT32 and ISO9660.  God's temple must be perfect.  Redundant code for
multiple 
file systems is imperfect.  For this operating system, we want low line
count. 
 More than one file system type is bad, just as more than one driver for the 
same type of device is bad.

[C:/Kernel/Dsk/FileSysRedSea.CPP.Z,1]
[C:/Kernel/Dsk/FileSysFAT.CPP.Z,1]	:965
[C:/Kernel/Dsk/FileSysISO.CPP.Z,1]	:284
[C:/Adam/Boot/DskCDDVD.CPP.Z,1]	:536
[C:/Kernel/Dsk/DskA.CPP.Z,535] RClustersBlks()

* Microsoft must cancel SecureBoot because it makes dual booting impossible.  
TempleOS is an additional operating system that must be used along-side 
Windows or Linux, not as a replacement.  It must dual boot because it has no 
networking.  Real hardware as opposed to VMware is like the difference
between 
looking in a telescope eye piece or not.  God said the C64 generation owned 
ancestral lands and VMware is like being moved on a reservation, but in this 
case it will not stand.

* PC hardware manufacturers?  ATA/ATAPI PIO must work.  In fact, put them at 
standard IDE port addresses.  Hard disk should be primary master 1F0/3F6.  
CDROM/DVD should be secondary master 170/376.  See what you can do to make 
flash memory sticks with ATA/ATAPI.
[C:/Kernel/Dsk/DskATAId.CPP.Z,1] /Kernel/Dsk/DskATAId.CPP	:280 lines to
figure-out I/O ports
[C:/Kernel/PCIBIOS.CPP.Z,1] /Kernel/PCIBIOS.CPP		:290 but I think we keep
this for people to 
play with.

* PS/2 emulated keyboard and mouse must work.  The BIOS must enable these.

* VMware must allow ATAPI interface to be routed to real CD/DVD hardware.

* Perhaps, VMware+Intel can enable faster x86 IN/OUT instruction timing for 
ATA/ATAPI PIO, so bandwidth isn't bad.  [C:/Kernel/Dsk/DskATA.CPP.Z,67]
ATAGetResult().

* Perhaps, Intel can make a fast software interrupt, the same as a CALL REL32?

* Since I don't use paging (for anything), Intel should have an option for  
no-paging long mode, and optimize it.

* Desktop computers must have a RESET switch and a fast reboot option, 
skipping diagnostics.  Build UEFI on a TempleOS layer.  Intel must burn 
TempleOS into a ROM at the factory for tamper-proof trust in the oracle.  A 
new ROM version is released every seven years.

* VMware and others must list TempleOS as an official 64-bit operating system.

* Windows Paint and Linux Gimp must support TempleOS .GRA graphics files.  
[C:/Doc/GRAFiles.TXT.Z,1] GRA Files are much cleaner than BMP files.

* We must have a nice dictionary.  Someone needs to do a
[C:/Demo/SuggestSpelling.CPP.Z,1] Spell Checker.

* We must have the ultimate Bible search engine.

* At some point in the distant future, we want serial ports with software 
interface like old style serial ports, but hardware and speed of USB3.  Make 
it an OCTART.  It should have big TX and RX FIFOs and allow flow control to 
jump the queue.  No USB end-point shit -- just put 8 ports on the PC.  (I am 
just interested in desktops.)  We need two baud rates, fast and slow.  Use
PIC 
IRQ3.  We want joysticks to be easy to set-up.  We want to be able to connect 
microcontrollers for general purpose communication.

* Once every 49 years is jubile and the hardware gets upgraded and perfected 
all at once, the same way broadcast TV get upgraded.  God still wants 640x480 
16 color, but make it a linear frame buffer one-byte-per-pixel and only 16 
color.


As it stands...

Device		Simple Hardware Interface	Complicate Interface
--------------- ------------------------------- -----------------------------
		1040-EZ Tax Form		1040 Regular 
Video		VGA 640x480 16 Color		20 Differnet GPUs
Sound		PC Speaker			HD Audio, AC97, Sound Blaster
HardDrive	ATA Port I/O, Sync No Interrupt	PCI AHCI SATA
CDROM		ATAPI Port I/O			PCI AHCI SATA
Keyboard/Mouse	PS/2 Port I/O			USB


During the 49 years jubile, we do a perfect version of hardware with advances 
in both the simple and complicated interfaces.  ATAPI/ATA, SSD and NV memory 
should be merged and made blemish-free.  We want flash memory sticks to 
interface like hard drives.  When you design, imagine you are creating the 
1040EZ tax form.  Do not add extra boxes.

A new ROM is released every seven years.  Development will take place between 
releases, obviously.  With the 100,000 line of code limit, it is supposed to 
get perfected into an unchanging diamond, quickly.  I want a committee to
work 
for a year.  Then, we release our first version.  I guess we allow boot-legs, 
freely.  The users can copy ROM and RAM and play with it, or boot hard disk 
versions.

In the meantime, BIOS makers must take the TempleOS code and modify it for 
their customers, as a product recall.  A PCI hard drive driver must be
written 
if the BIOS you created does not work with the standard TempleOS ATA/ATAPI 
port IO.  You must also bypass SecureBoot and make sure the keyboard and
mouse 
work if you do not support legacy PS/2, by writing a USB driver.

I want to offer "Knuth-bucks" for changes that reduce lines of code other
than 
reformatting.  I want to offer Knuth bucks for pointing-out spelling and
other 
imperfections.  Some imperfections are by design, however.
