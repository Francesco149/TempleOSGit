                              RedSea File System

The RedSea file system is a simple, 64-bit, file system which is similar to 
FAT32, but with absolute block addresses instead of clusters, fixed-sized 
64-byte directory entries and no FAT table, just an allocation bitmap.  A 
cluster is just one 512 byte sector.  Files are stored in contiguous blocks 
and cannot grow in size.

#define CDIR_FILENAME_LEN	38 //Must include terminator zero

public class CDirEntry //64-byte fixed-size
{
  U16 attr;	//See [C:/Kernel/Adam1a.HPP.Z,2432] RS_ATTR_DIR.  I would like to
change these.
  U8 name[CDIR_FILENAME_LEN]; //See [C:/Kernel/Str1a.CPP.Z,336]
chars_bitmap_filename, [C:/Kernel/Dsk/DskStr.CPP.Z,294] FileNameChk
  I64 cluster;	//One sector per cluster.  I might change origin, let's talk.
  I64 size;	//In bytes
  CDate datetime; //See  [C:/Doc/TimeDate.TXT.Z,1] DateTime,
[C:/Kernel/Date.CPP.Z,1] Implementation of DateTime
};

public class CRedSeaBoot //RedSea is type FAT32 in partition table to fool 
BIOS.
{
  U8 jump_and_nop[3];
  U8 signature,reserved[4]; //MBR_PT_REDSEA=0x88. Distinguish from real FAT32.
  I64 base_offset;	//For CD/DVD image copy.
  I64 sects;
  I64 root_cluster;
  I64 bitmap_sects;
  I64 unique_id;
  U8 code[462];
  U16 signature2;	//0xAA55
};

See [C:/Kernel/Dsk/FileSysRedSea.CPP.Z,1] implementation of RedSea file
system.

File with names ending in .Z are stored compressed.
See [C:/Kernel/Compress.CPP.Z,1] implementation of LZW compression.

I hope to do a ISO9660 replacement that consists of a hard-drive partition 
image copied onto a CD/DVD starting at about sector 20 with EL TORITO
booting. 
 512-byte sectors will be placed on top of 2048-byte CD/DCD sectors, so there 
will be four blocks per CD/DVD sector.

There is no bad block table and no redundant allocation table.
