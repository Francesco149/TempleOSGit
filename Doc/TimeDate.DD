TempleOS uses a 64-bit value, [C:/Kernel/KernelA.HH.Z,186] CDate, for
date/time.  The upper 32-bits are the 
days since Christ.  The lower 32-bits store time of day divided by 4 billion 
which works out to 49710ths of a second.  You can subtract two
[C:/Kernel/KernelA.HH.Z,186] CDate's to get 
a time span.

Use [C:/Kernel/KernelA.HH.Z,571] CDATE_FREQ to convert.
