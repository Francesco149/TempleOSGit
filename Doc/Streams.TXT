There are no streams in the traditional sense.  The cmd line output gets sent 
to the cursor location of a document being edited and by using cursor keys, 
text can be injected all over the document.  [Sprites,1] Sprites can be
injected and are 
not serialized!  Furthermore, the input can come from triggering macro 
widgets.  See [C:/Doc/DolDocOverview.TXT.Z,1] Doc Overview and [DolDoc,1] Doc
Routines.

If you had a remote term and sent key [C:/Kernel/KernelA.HPP.Z,3477] Scan
Codes, the user would press <CTRL-m
> to access his Personal Menu to trigger his macros.  However, the local 
[C:/Home/PersonalMenu.TXT,1] might differ from the remote, causing loss of
sync 
between local and remote sessions.  Also, the window size of local and remote 
might differ, so word-wrapped text would be different.  Injecting output text 
with different windows sizes would cause remote and local documents to not be 
in sync.

See [C:/Doc/CharOverview.TXT.Z,1] Char Overview and [Char,1] Char Routines.

You can send characters into StdIn.  See [C:/Kernel/SrvCmd.CPP.Z,496] Auto(),
[C:/Kernel/SrvCmd.CPP.Z,459] XTalk() and [AutoFile,1] AutoFile.
