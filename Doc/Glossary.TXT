+] Task/Process/Thread
  There is no distinction between task, process or thread.  The Fs segment
  reg is kept pointing to the current task's [C:/Kernel/KernelA.HPP.Z,3212]
  CTask.  There is only one window per task, and only core#0 tasks can have
  windows.  Each task has a code and data heap so memory is returned when it
  dies.  Each task has a [Hash,1] hash symbol table.
+] Adam Task
  This is Adam, as in Adam and Eve, the parent of all tasks and immortal. 
  This task is created at start-up and appears in the small window at the top
  beneath the user windows.  On it's heap are all memory objects which you
  don't want destroyed by a task's death.  When created, Adam runs the file
  [C:/Adam.CPP.Z,1].  When start-up is finished, the adam task enters a server
  mode where it accepts requests from other tasks.  The
  [C:/Kernel/SrvCmd.CPP.Z,417] Adam("") routine will make Adam compile and run
  text src code.  #include statements can be sent to
  [C:/Kernel/SrvCmd.CPP.Z,417] Adam(""), creating system-wide code and data
  which don't disappear when any particular task ends.
+] Seth Task
  Seth is Adam and Eve's child.  Each CPU core has a special task which is
  immortal and which is special.  The Adam task on CPU#0 is also it's Seth task.
+] Code and Data Heaps
  TempleOS uses the asm CALL instruction, exclusively, and that instruction
  is limited to calling routines +/-2 Gig from the current code location.  To
  prevent out-of-range issues, I decided to separate code and data, placing all
  code within the lowest 2 Gig of memory, addresses 00000000-7FFFFFFF.  The
  compiler and [C:/Kernel/KLoad.CPP.Z,179] Load()er alloc memory from the code
  heap to store code and glbl vars, unless the compiler option
  [C:/Kernel/KernelA.HPP.Z,1462] OPTf_GLBLS_ON_DATA_HEAP is used.  When
  programs call [C:/Kernel/MemB.CPP.Z,373] MAlloc() is from the data heap,
  which in not limited in size, except by physical RAM memory.  You can alloc
  from any heap in any task at any time on any core, even making
  [C:/Kernel/MemA.CPP.Z,192] independent heaps.
+] Parent, Child and PopUp Tasks
  Often a task will [C:/Kernel/Task.CPP.Z,207] Spawn() or
  [C:/Kernel/SrvCmd.CPP.Z,384] PopUp() a task as a helper.  The helper is known
  as a child Task, though you can [C:/Kernel/Task.CPP.Z,207] Spawn a task and
  assign it a different parent... like Adam.  Links are kept as to who's whose
  child, so when one task is [C:/Kernel/Task.CPP.Z,28] Kill()ed the child
  helper tasks die, too.  You can get a report of current system tasks with
  [C:/Adam/AUtils.CPP.Z,200] TaskRep().  There is just one window per task, so
  child tasks are needed for pop-ups.
+] HolyC
  [C:/Doc/HolyC.TXT.Z,1] HolyC is more than C and less than C++.  It has the
  default args of C++ and uses class in place of struct.  It uses
  U0,U8,U16,U32,I64 and I0,I8,I16,I32,I64 for signed and unsigned integers.  It
  has different [C:/Doc/HolyC.TXT.Z,1] operator precedence.  It has PASCAL-like
  function calls with no parens, but requires an & when referring to function
  addresses.
+] AOT Compile Mode
  Ahead-of-Time compiling is conventional compilation mode.  Do not use AOT,
  use JIT compiling.

In AOT mode, .PRJ files are compiled to .BIN files, skipping .OBJ files. 
  After compiling, .BIN files are [C:/Kernel/KLoad.CPP.Z,179] Load()ed.

There is no main() routine.  Instead, statements outside functions are
  automatically executed upon loading.  There is no way to unload except by
  killing the task.  To invoke AOT Compiled Mode, [C:/Compiler/CMain.CPP.Z,432]
  Cmp() is used.  The Kernel module and compiler are made in AOT compiled mode.
   See [C:/Adam/Boot/BootIns.CPP.Z,24] MakeOSDrvBootInstall()  which calls
  [C:/Adam/Boot/BootIns.CPP.Z,13] MakeAll() where Kernel.BIN.C and
  Compiler.BIN.Z are created.
+] JIT Compile Mode
  In just-in-time mode, the compiler places code and data in memory alloced
  from the heap, incrementally, making them immediately ready for in-place
  execution.  This mode is used during cmd line operations.  When you #include
  a file, it is compiled function by function and code ends-up all over in the
  memory, at least in the first 2Gig of memory.  The
  [C:/Compiler/CMain.CPP.Z,627] ExeFile() routine is the same as #include but
  can be used in programs.  [C:/Compiler/CMain.CPP.Z,618] ExePrint() routine
  will compile and run a string.
+] Compiler Intermediate Code
  The compiler generates instructions one step before making actual assembly
  (machine) language instructions.  This code is reverse polish stack machine
  in nature and can be viewed with [C:/Compiler/CMisc.CPP.Z,21] OTrace().  The
  compiler does not interpret code, except in the process of optimization to
  make the final machine code.  Assembly language output can be viewed when
  code is compiled with the [C:/Compiler/CMisc.CPP.Z,33] CTrace(), or,
  afterward, with [C:/Compiler/UAsm.CPP.Z,640] U() or [C:/Adam/ADbg.CPP.Z,249]
  Uf("").
+] Drive/Partition
  There is no distinction between drive or partition.  They are specified
  with a single letter from A-Z.

':' is the boot drive.

For commands taking a drive letter as an argument, char 0 is the current
  drive.

+] Filename Extention Types

  These files are automatically compressed or uncompresses files when read or
  written.
*.???.C
  Contiguous files--NOT compressed.
*.TXT.Z;*.TXT;*.LOG.Z;*.LOG
  Text Files
*.CPP.Z;*.CPP
  HolyC src files.  The default HolyC compiler type is .CPP.Z.
*.PRJ.Z;*.PRJ
  HolyC src files to be compiled AOT.
*.HPP.Z;*.HPP
  HolyC src header files.
*.MAP.Z;*.MAP

+] Naming Convention
  Since there are no namespaces and I don't plan to implement name spaces, I
  highly recommend putting a 2-3 character module code prefix on syms. e.g. WS,
  Doc, Lex

ALL_CAPS
  Assembly Language labels are capitalized with underscores between words. 
  So are #define's.

_ALL_CAPS
  Asm routines which are [C:/Doc/HolyC.TXT.Z,1] HolyC callible should have a
  leading underscore.

MixedCaps
  [C:/Doc/HolyC.TXT.Z,1] HolyC Functions and class names are MixedCaps.

lower_case
  Local function vars and glbl vars are lower case.  Class member names are
  also lower_case.

_lower_case
  Function args which are outputs (passed as ptrs) have leading underscores. 
  Also, args which have identically named local variable counterparts have
  leading underscores. 

DOCf_????
  Flags bit nums instead of bit values are designated with a lower case f.

DOCG_????
  Flag groups are designated with "G".

result is reserved for local variables that hold the function return val.

* I used C++ like naming.  I place New, Del, Init, Rst, ect. on the end of a
  function name instead of at the beginning.  RstMusicSettings should be
  MusicSettingsRst.
+] Fs
  The CPU FS segment reg.  This reg points to the current task's
  [C:/Kernel/KernelA.HPP.Z,3212] CTask.
+] Gs
  The CPU GS segment reg.  This reg points to the current core's
  [C:/Kernel/KernelA.HPP.Z,3338] CCPU.
+] Heap
  Programs can dynamically request chunks of memory alloced from a heap using
  [C:/Kernel/MemB.CPP.Z,373] MAlloc().  They must [C:/Kernel/MemB.CPP.Z,369]
  Free() it when finished.  Ptrs are used to refer to the chunk.  The heap is
  dynamically alloced mem.
+] Root
  The base of a binary tree or the head of a queue is the root.  (I don't
  like the word head.)
+] Join
  When two parts of a program have a common low-level routine, that routine
  is often labeled SomethingJoin.
+] user_data
  Many operating system structures have space set aside for you to store
  values.  You are on your own managing these with multiple applications and
  libraries.
+] Multicore BSP/AP Processors
  The boot-strap processor is core#0, has the Adam task, and it is the
  master.  The application processors have Seth tasks and are the slave
  processors.  Only the BSP core#0 processor's tasks can have windows.  More or
  less, applications are launched exclusively from the BSP processor.  It is
  the master.  The only way slave cores get used is if the application
  explicitly [C:/Kernel/Task.CPP.Z,207] Spawns() a task on them or
  [C:/Kernel/MultiProc.CPP.Z,232] JobQue() a job on them.
