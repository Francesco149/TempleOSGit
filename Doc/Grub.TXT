                          The Grub Master Bootloader

Here are my grub.cfg file entries for my TempleOS partitions.  I don't have 
the patience to do it correctly and GRUB obfuscates.  Chain loading is just 
the normal way an operating system like Windows boots.  They do drives, 
zero-based, and partitions on drives, one-based.  They call traditional 
partitioning a "msdos" partition and I presume, if there is a new way to 
partition drives, it has a new name.

In addition to a Windows and a Linux partition, I have a Primary TempleOS
'D', 
Backup TempleOS 'E' and a Transfer 'I' partition for transferring between 
Windows and TempleOS.  "hd0" is 1st hard drive, zero-based numbering.
"msdos1" 
is partition #1, traditional msdos partitioning.  I keep 'D', 'E', and 'I' 
identical by frequently copying all files and I use 'I' to transfer files.  
They only need to be a couple Gig in size.  Every time I copy files, use 
[C:/Adam/Boot/InsBoot.CPP.Z,135] MakeOSPrtBootInstall() to
[C:/Adam/Boot/InsBoot.CPP.Z,122] MakeAll and prepare the partition
[C:/Adam/Boot/BootHD.CPP.Z,1] boot sector for 
chainloading by patching the new block address and size of Kernel.BIN.C.

menuentry "TempleOS D" {
	insmod chain
	set root=(hd0,msdos1)
	chainloader +1
}

menuentry "TempleOS E" {
	insmod chain
	set root=(hd0,msdos5)
	chainloader +1
}

menuentry "TempleOS I" {
	insmod chain
	set root=(hd1,msdos5)
	chainloader +1
}
