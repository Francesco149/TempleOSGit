The word Pag refers to an arbitrilly created [C:/Kernel/KernelA.HH.Z,2874]
MEM_PAG_SIZE unit of heap 
allocation.  TempleOS does not alter the CPU page tables after setting them
up 
at boot in [C:/Kernel/Mem/PageTables.HC.Z,6] SYS_INIT_PAGE_TABLES, so the CPU
hardware page size is rarely 
important.
