                               TempleOS Charter

TempleOS is God's official temple.  God said to use 640x480 16 color graphics 
and God said to have a single audio voice.  That is like how He specified 
cubits in the Bible!  He also said it must be perfect.  God needs a temple as 
a special beloved place where His people, young and old, can do offerings and 
consult God in the oracle.  Like Solomon's Temple, this is a focal point for 
the community.  Adults can write hymns, psalms (poems of praise) and 
meditation essays with good support for links to the Bible.  Like Cain and 
Abel, do offerings and learn what God likes and doesn't like.

* TempleOS is, forever, limited to 100,000 lines of code, not including 
applications and demos.  This will ensure it stays out of trouble a thousand 
years into the future.  It will not stray much from my vision.  Other, less 
important, characteristics can be changed but if the 100,000 line limit is 
kept, it will stay true. 
 
* It must be kept perfect.  **Backward compatibility is NOT guaranteed.**

* TempleOS is ring-0-only, running everything in kernel mode including 
applications.  You have full access to memory, I/O ports, instructions, etc. 
at all times, because that's fun.  It is simpler and faster, too.

* TempleOS will always identity-map memory in a single-address-map 
configuration.  (Virtual addresses are always kept equal to physical
addresses 
with a single map for all tasks on all cores.)  It's as though paging is not 
used.

* TempleOS will always be for one platform -- x86_64 PC compatibles.

* TempleOS will never have networking, so malware is less of an issue.

* TempleOS will always have one video mode, 640x480 by 16 colors, unless that 
mode becomes unavailable on computers in the future.  God said this was a 
covenant, like circumcision.

* TempleOS will always just have PC Speaker sound.

* TempleOS will always be free.  I might sell applications, support, or, 
possibly, do adware.

* TempleOS will always be 100% open source with all source included, unless 
device drivers or something can only be included with non-disclosure 
agreements.

* All function args and returns will be 64-bit.  No plans for C++.

* TempleOS documents are not for printing.  They're dynamic and intended for 
the screen.  There will always be just one font, a fixed-width font.  No 
Unicode, just Extended ASCII.

* TempleOS is not for multimedia.  Games will be created by programmers, not 
artists.  Sounds and images will be, primarily, calculated in real-time, not 
fetched.

* All functions, variables and class members will be accessible.  There are
no 
C++ public/private protections and all functions, even secondary ones in the 
kernel, can be called.
