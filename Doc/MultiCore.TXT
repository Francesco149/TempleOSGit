TempleOS does master-slave multicore instead of SMP.  Core#0 is the master.  
The master core assigns computational jobs to other cores.  It is
symmetrical, 
however, in the sense that you can freely do file access and heap allocations 
because there are locks.  See [C:/Demo/MultiCore/LoadTest.CPP,1].  TempleOS
does 
not move tasks between cores.

Only tasks on core#0 can have windows, but other cores can help render them.

Each core has a seth task which is the father of all tasks on that core. 
Adam 
is the seth task on core 0.

You give a job to a seth task with [C:/Kernel/MultiProc.CPP.Z,232] JobQue()
and get the result with 
[C:/Kernel/SrvCmd.CPP.Z,201] JobResultGet().  You spawn a task on another
core with [C:/Kernel/Task.CPP.Z,209] Spawn().

Note: You must use the LOCK asm prefix when changing shared structures in a 
multicore environment.  The [C:/Kernel/KernelB.HPP.Z,26] LBts(),
[C:/Kernel/KernelB.HPP.Z,24] LBtr() and [C:/Kernel/KernelB.HPP.Z,22] LBtc()
instructions have LOCK 
prefixes.  The compiler has a lock{} feature but it doesn't work well.  See 
[C:/Demo/MultiCore/Lock.CPP,1].
