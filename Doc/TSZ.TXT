                              Linux TSZ Utility


TSZ [-ascii] filename

Will uncompress a single file from within Linux.  The -ascii flag will
convert 
the irregular TempleOS ASCII 5 and ASCII 31 characters to spaces.  (ASCII 5
is 
used to mark the cursor pos and ASCII 31 is used for shifted space characters 
and will cause problems unless you convert them.)


                             Windows TSZ Utility

TSZ will uncompress TempleOS files you have gotten to Windows.  There are two 
ways to get files from TempleOS to Windows -- via CD-ROM or via a FAT32 
partition.


TSZ [-ascii] dirname:

will uncompress all TempleOS files with names ending in ".Z" in a Windows 
directory and in all subdirectories.  The -ascii flag used in combination
will 
convert the irregular TempleOS ASCII 5 and ASCII 31 characters to spaces.  
(ASCII 5 is used to mark the cursor pos and ASCII 31 is used for shifted
space 
characters and will cause problems unless you convert them.)  Note: If you 
pick names not ending in ".Z", they will not need to be uncompressed.  You
can 
[C:/Adam/Dsk/Dsk2a.CPP.Z,118] Move() or [C:/Adam/Dsk/Dsk2a.CPP.Z,90] Copy()
them to a name not ending in ".Z" and they will be stored 
uncompressed.
