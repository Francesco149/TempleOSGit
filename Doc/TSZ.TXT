                              Linux TSZ Utility


TSZ [-ascii] filename

Will uncompress a single file from within Linux.  The -ascii flag will
convert 
the irregular TempleOS ASCII 5 and ASCII 31 characters to spaces.  (ASCII 5
is 
used to mark the cursor pos and ASCII 31 is used for shifted space characters 
and will cause problems unless you convert them.)
