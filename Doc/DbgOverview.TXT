                              Debugging Overview

* You can enter the debugger with [C:/Kernel/KDbg.CPP.Z,637] Dbg() or
<CTRL-ALT-d>.  You might enter the 
debugger through a fault.  Enter [C:/Kernel/KDbg.CPP.Z,449] G() or
[C:/Kernel/KDbg.CPP.Z,474] G2() to continue execution.  Place a 
call to [C:/Kernel/KDbg.CPP.Z,637] Dbg() in your code at fatal error points
to enter the debugger.  If 
you see a stk dump, record the label+offset and unassemble,
[C:/Compiler/UAsm.CPP.Z,640] U(). [C:/Compiler/UAsm.CPP.Z,640]
U([C:/Kernel/KernelA.HPP.Z,3322] _RIP); 

* [C:/Compiler/UAsm.CPP.Z,640] U(&FunName+offset) to unassemble mem or
[C:/Adam/ADbg.CPP.Z,249] Uf("FunName") to unassemble a 
function. [C:/Compiler/UAsm.CPP.Z,640] U([C:/Kernel/KernelA.HPP.Z,3322]
_RIP-16);

* While debugging, you specify addresses of assembly routines with just the 
label, as in _MALLOC+0x20.  You specify [C:/Doc/HolyC.TXT.Z,1] HolyC function
names with & before 
functions as in &Print+0x10.

* I use [C:/Kernel/KernelB.HPP.Z,162] progress1-[C:/Kernel/KernelB.HPP.Z,171]
progress4 for debugging because they show on the wallpaper.  
They're just global integer vars.

* You can use [C:/Kernel/SrvCmd.CPP.Z,436] AdamLog() to send text to the Adam
task window.  It works like 
[C:/Kernel/StrPrint.CPP.Z,896] Print().  I never use that.  Instead, I use
[C:/Kernel/KDbg.CPP.Z,215] RawPrint().

* [C:/Kernel/KDbg.CPP.Z,170] D(), [C:/Adam/DolDoc/DocMain.CPP.Z,568] DocD(),
[C:/Kernel/KDbg.CPP.Z,232] RawD() to do 16 column hex dump mem with numbering
from zero.  
With [C:/Adam/DolDoc/DocMain.CPP.Z,568] DocD the values are updated
continually and you can alter mem by editing.

* [C:/Kernel/KDbg.CPP.Z,202] Dm(), [C:/Adam/DolDoc/DocMain.CPP.Z,555]
DocDm(), [C:/Kernel/KDbg.CPP.Z,248] RawDm() to do 16 column hex dump mem with
addresses showing.

* [C:/Kernel/KDbg.CPP.Z,207] Da() to do one column address dump (for stk,
etc.) with symbolic addresses.

* [C:/Kernel/KDbg.CPP.Z,326] Dr() dumps regs.  You can display and modify
regs in the debugger with 
var-like labels, _RAX, _RBX, etc.

* [C:/Adam/ADbg.CPP.Z,152] ClassRep() and the dynamic version
[C:/Adam/ADbg.CPP.Z,176] ClassRepD() can be used to dump 
structures.

* [C:/Adam/Utils/Profiler.CPP.Z,27] Prof() and
[C:/Adam/Utils/Profiler.CPP.Z,57] ProfRep() provide code profiling.  See 
[C:/Demo/AutoFile/AFProfile.AUT.Z,1] (This is an [C:/Doc/Glossary.TXT.Z,1]
AutoFile.)

* Use [C:/Kernel/KDbg.CPP.Z,215] RawPrint() to print debug info bypassing the
window framework.  You pass 
these routines a count in milliseconds for how long it should be displayed.  
You can use [C:/Kernel/KMisc.CPP.Z,248] Raw(TRUE) to make all output bypass
the window framework.  The 
WinMgr runs on core0 and will overwrite raw text from other cores when it 
updates the screen.

* Use [C:/Kernel/KMisc.CPP.Z,238] SysDbg() to set a flag which you can read
with [C:/Kernel/KMisc.CPP.Z,243] IsSysDbg() when you wish 
to trigger some debug activity.  It's just a handy simple flag, nothing fancy.

* There are flags for various trace options that can help debugging when
there 
are compiler bugs.  Often, you place them in #exe{} blocks.
  
[C:/Compiler/CMisc.CPP.Z,38] Echo() turns on or off raw data going into the
  lexical analyzer.

[C:/Compiler/CMisc.CPP.Z,33] CTrace() unassembles code generated from the
  HolyC compiler.

[C:/Compiler/CMisc.CPP.Z,21] OTrace() shows intermediate code coming-out
  after optimization.  [C:/Compiler/CMisc.CPP.Z,26] OTraceMask(
) ctrls which passes are displayed.


* There is a heap check utility which can find leaks.  Use
[C:/Adam/Utils/HeapLog.CPP.Z,68] HeapLog(), and 
[C:/Adam/Utils/HeapLog.CPP.Z,110] HeapLogRep().  It's a really simple program
which intercepts [C:/Kernel/MemB.CPP.Z,373] MAlloc() and 
[C:/Kernel/MemB.CPP.Z,369] Free().  You can customize the code to find other
heap issues.

* You can define handler functions for <CTRL-ALT-letter> keys with 
[C:/Kernel/KbdMouse/Keyboard.CPP.Z,401] CtrlAltLetCBSet().  They operate
either in a interrupt environment or in the 
window mgr when it queues kbd msgs.  You can do [C:/Kernel/KMisc.CPP.Z,248]
Raw() output.  <CTRL-ALT-lette
r> handlers take a scan_code as an arg.

* If you recompile Kernel with [C:/Adam/Boot/BootIns.CPP.Z,24]
MakeOSDrvBootInstall(), you can set the MemInit
, option to initialize memory to a value at boot, the HeapInit option to
cause 
mem alloced off the heap to be initialized or VarInit option so both global 
and local vars will be initialized to a value.  Pick a non-zero value to 
discover uninitialized var bugs.  You can set [C:/Kernel/KernelB.HPP.Z,147]
sys_var_init_flag, and 
[C:/Kernel/KernelB.HPP.Z,142] sys_heap_init_flag directly after booting.
