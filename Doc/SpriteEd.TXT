                            Sprite Edit Menu Help

Order of elements matters.  They are executed in the order they appear in the 
side-bar.  You can sel or unsel elements graphically, or with text in the 
sidebar.  Then, cut, copy, paste, shift or transform them.

You can set the current insert point element by clicking the element in the 
side-bar and making it RED.

Insert Shift Suborigin is an element which shifts subsequent elements.  
Perhaps, you inserted a sprite's elements from the clipboard and want to
shift 
it around?  This command is also useful if you call
[C:/Adam/Gr/GrSpritePlot.CPP.Z,330] SpriteInterpolate() in 
programs.
