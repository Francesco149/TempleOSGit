                            Sprite Edit Menu Help

Order of elements matters.  They are executed in the order they appear in the 
side-bar.  You can set the current element by clicking the element in the 
side-bar and making it RED.

DELETE will delete the RED element in the side-bar.  You can just delete 
elements directly in the side-bar as long as you click another element to 
update things.

You can delete or select elements graphically.

You can insert an element which shifts around all subsequent other elements.  
Perhaps, you inserted a sprite's elements from the clip-board and want to 
chift it around.  This command is also useful if you interpolate in programs.
