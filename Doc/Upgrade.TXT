                              Upgrading TempleOS

To upgrade, you generally boot the new TempleOS CD/DVD, install on top of
your 
drive, modify your files and set it to boot your account by executing 
[C:/Adam/Boot/InsBoot.CPP.Z,130] MakeOSDrvBootInstall().  Often, your code
will have to be modified to work 
with the new version.  See [C:/Doc/ChangeLog.TXT.Z,1] Change Log.  You might
have to boot an alternate 
drive or the CD and modify your code until it boots okay.

The INSTALL option when you boot a CD will install on top of an existing 
install if you tell it not to reformat.

See the [C:/Doc/Install.TXT.Z,1] Installing documentation.
