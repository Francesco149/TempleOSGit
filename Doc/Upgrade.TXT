                              Upgrading TempleOS

To upgrade, you generally boot the new TempleOS CD/DVD, install on top of
your 
partition, modify your files and set it to boot your account by executing 
[MN:MakeOSPrtBootInstall] MakeOSPrtBootInstall().  Often, your code will have
to be modified to work 
with the new version.  See [C:/Doc/ChangeLog.TXT,1] ChangeLog.  You might
have to boot an alternate 
partition or the CD and modify your code until it boots okay.

The INSTALL option when you boot a CD will install on top of an existing 
install if you tell it not to reformat.

See the [C:/Doc/Install.TXT,1] Installing documentation.
