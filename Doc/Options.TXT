                               Compiler Options

Use [C:/Compiler/ICLCC.CPP.Z,6] OptOn() [C:/Compiler/ICLCC.CPP.Z,11]
OptOff().  You might need to do #exe {OptOn();}.

[C:/Kernel/Adam1a.HPP.Z,1474] OPTf_GLBLS_ON_DATA_HEAP without this option,
global vars are placed in the 
code heap which is limited to 2 Gig.  In AOT modules, global vars take-up
room 
in the .BIN file, so you might want to use this option, instead.  You might 
wish to turn it on and off around specific vars.  A disadvantage of data heap 
global vars in AOT modules is they can't be initialized.

[C:/Kernel/Adam1a.HPP.Z,1471] OPTf_EXTERNS_TO_IMPORTS and
[C:/Kernel/Adam1a.HPP.Z,1472] OPTf_KEEP_PRIVATE are strange options, you'll 
never need.  They're to allow the same header file for Kernel to act as extern
s when compiling itself and imports when compiled by AOT modules.

[C:/Kernel/Adam1a.HPP.Z,1468] OPTf_WARN_UNUSED_VAR	warning if unused var.  It
is applied to functions.

[C:/Kernel/Adam1a.HPP.Z,1469] OPTf_WARN_PAREN		warning if parenthesis are not
needed.

[C:/Kernel/Adam1a.HPP.Z,1470] OPTf_WARN_DUP_TYPES	warning if dup local var
type statements.

[C:/Kernel/Adam1a.HPP.Z,1473] OPTf_NO_REG_VAR forces all function local vars
to the stk not regs.  Applied 
to functions.

[C:/Kernel/Adam1a.HPP.Z,1476] OPTf_NO_BUILTIN_CONST Disable 10-byte float
consts for pi, log2_10, log10_2, 
loge_2.  Applied to functions.
