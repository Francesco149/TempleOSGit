A CSprite, is an ordered list of [C:/Adam/Gr/Gr.CPP.Z,22] these elements,
created with <CTRL-r>.  
Normally, they are packed together in a list and the address of the first is 
passed to routines.

See [C:/Demo/Graphics/SpritePlot.CPP.Z,1],
[C:/Demo/Graphics/SpritePlot3D.CPP.Z,1], 
[C:/Demo/Graphics/SpritePut.CPP.Z,1] and [C:/Adam/Gr/SpriteMesh.CPP.Z,869]
SpriteMeshEd().

Be aware that copying SP, IB, or IS entries with the clipboard results in 
duplicate entries with different nums.  You can manually remove dups by 
editing with <CTRL-t> and setting to the original num.

See [C:/Adam/Gr/GrSpritePlot.CPP.Z,1] ::/Adam/Gr/GrSpritePlot.CPP for how
CSprite are stored.
