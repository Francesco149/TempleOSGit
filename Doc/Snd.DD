Sound is generated with I8 vals called ona's, which are 88 piano key nums, 
with 0 as a rest.  See [C:/Adam/ASnd.HC.Z,183] Note2Ona() and
[C:/Kernel/KMisc.HC.Z,163] Ona2Freq().  God does not want death 
screams, perhaps, because God has PTSD or soldiers have PTSD.  (Imagine 
wounded on battlefields.)  Ona's will allow elegant wave files for export and 
will allow the creation of simple hardware over the next centuries.
