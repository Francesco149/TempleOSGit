                                 PreProcessor

There is no separate preprocessor pass.  The parser front-end calls
[C:/Compiler/Lex.CPP.Z,443] Lex() 
which has the preprocessor built-in.  The compiler looks ahead a token, most 
of the time, so you might throw an extra semicolon after a directive if it's 
not taking affect right away.

Put an extra semicolon #exe {Cd("DirName");;} in case a #include follows.

#include "" 	There is no angle bracket <> form of this directive.
#exe {}		Will execute code at compile-time and can be used to insert 
code into the stream being compiled using [C:/Compiler/CMisc.CPP.Z,68]
StreamPrint().
#define		Define string const
#assert		Print a warning during compilation if an expression is not 
true. 
#if		Include code if an expresion is true.
#else
#endif
#ifdef,#ifndef	Include code if a sym is defined.
#ifaot,#ifjit	Include code if in AOT compiler mode.
defined()	Is a function that can be used in expressions.
