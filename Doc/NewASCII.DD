                                  New ASCII


We want to use one set for ASCII, ScanCodes and ScreenCodes.


0  -63  :
64 -127 : SHIFT
128-191 : CTRL
192-256 : CTRL+SHIFT

No more ALT key in TempleOS.

CTRL-LEFT/RIGHT is already begin/end line.
CTRL-UP/DOWN    is already top/bottom of document.

What about function keys?
We will use reduced keyboard, probably.
