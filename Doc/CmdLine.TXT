The cmd line feeds into the [C:/Doc/HolyC.TXT.Z,1] HolyC compiler as you
type.  A statement outside a 
function executes immediately.  Remember to add a semicolon.

Look-up the function headers with WordStat by hitting <CTRL-SHIFT-F1> after

[C:/Kernel/Dsk/Dsk1b.CPP.Z,243] Click Here to see the directory cmd header. 
It accepts default args from C++.

Dir("*.TXT.Z");

If you don't have args, you don't need parenthesis.

Dir;

There is a current directory, but not a path.  To run a program, you
typically 
#include it.  There are several shortcuts for #includeing files.  Right-click 
or hit enter on a directory listing or press F5 while editing.

Ed("NewFile.CPP.Z");

Most filenames end in ".Z" because they are stored compressed.

Drives are specified with a letter.  The boot drive is specified with a ':'.

Drv('B');		B drive

The drive can be specified in a [C:/Kernel/Dsk/Dsk1b.CPP.Z,37] Cd() command
as in:

Cd("B:/Temp");	B drive
Cd("::/Demo");	Boot drive

Cd("HOME/MusicOrgan");	HOME is a dir

You can place macros in your personal menu for [C:/Kernel/Dsk/Dsk1b.CPP.Z,37]
Cd() commands.  <CTRL-M> to 
access your menu.
