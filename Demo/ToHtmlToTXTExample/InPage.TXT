TempleOS is a free, public domain, open source, x86_64, non-preemptive 
multi-tasking, multi-cored, ring-0-only, single-address-map
(identity-mapped), 
non-networked, PC operating system.  Paging is, basically, not used.

This "Hello World" joke, the BMP file format and the WAV file format show
that 
the industry is really screwed-up!  That's what TempleOS fixes.  I capped the 
line-of-code count at 100,000 and God said it must be perfect, so it will 
never be an ugly monstrocity.  It is currently 79,934 lines of unblemished 
code.  Backward compatibility is not promised.

Normally, failure is not an option, but since TempleOS accompanies Windows or 
Linux, we exclude certain uses.  There is no reason to duplicate browsing, 
multimedia, desktop publishing, etc.  Linux wants to be a secure, multi-user 
mainframe.  That's why it has file permissions.  The vision for TempleOS, 
however, is a modern, 64-bit Commodore 64.  The C64 was a non-networked, home 
computer mostly used for games.  It trained my generation how to program 
because it was wide open, completely hackable.  The games were not multimedia 
works of art, but generated by non-artist.

A troll might ask, "Why not just use DOS?  It was ring-0-only and 
single-address-map."  DOS was 16-bit, with segmentation -- awful!  TempleOS
is 
64-bit, flat, non-segmented and multi-cored.  It has a C64-like shell with 
[C:/Doc/HolyC.TXT.Z,1] HolyC, a dialect of C/C++, instead of BASIC.  It was
written from scratch, and 
not even ASCII was sacred -- it has 8-bit unsigned char source code to
support 
European languages.  Also, the source code supports binary sprite graphics.

A troll might say, "It can crash!"  We used DOS for years and loved it. 
Computers even had a reset switch!  Just think of the power of ring-0, 
muhahaha! Think of the speed and simplicity of ring-0-only and 
identity-mapping.  It can change tasks in half a microsecond because it 
doesn't mess with page tables or privilege levels.  Inter-process 
communication is effortless because every task can access every other task's 
memory.

It's fun having access to everything.  When I was a teenager, I had a book, 
Mapping the Commodore 64, that told what every location in memory did.  I 
liked copying the ROM to RAM and poking around at the ROM BASIC's variables.  
Everybody directly poked the hardware ports.

TempleOS is simpler than Linux and you can have hours of fun tinkering
because 
all memory and ports are accessible.  Memory is identity-mapped at all times, 
so you can modify any task's memory from any other task.  You can access all 
disk blocks, too.  I had a blast using a C64 disk block editor to modify 
directories to un-delete files, when I was a kid.  Maybe, you want to play 
with a raw-block database, or make your own file system?

I wrote all [C:/Home/Web/LineRep.TXT,1] 119,798 lines of TempleOS over the
last 17.3 years, full-time, 
including the 64-bit compiler.  It was called, at various times, "Hoppy", "
The J Operating System", "LoseThos" and "SparrowOS".  Here are my 
college transcripts.  I've been a professional operating system developer 
since 1990 when I was hired to work on Ticketmaster's VAX OS.
