* We don't know why tS caused crash, perhaps, semaphores are broken.
  (Hangs on 2nd ScreenUpdate, black almost. Perhaps bug from with [MN:gr_pan_text_x] gr_pan_text_x.)
  Fixed with HPET in tS.

GrEditBitMap, grabscroll? 

extern of fun with dft arg of str?

* We kinda need a routine to return how much free memory, so that applications can plan a big alloc.

* FileMgr bad with lots of files.  

* This [C:/Kernel/SrvCmd.CPP,1] Fs->catch_except=TRUE causes problems because it catches divide and out-of-mem.  Not sure what to do, yet.
* [C:/TempleOS/Kernel/MultiProc.CPP.Z,400] MPStart() free old task memory. (Prolly never gonna do anything about this.)
* [C:/TempleOS/Kernel/Adam1b.HPP.Z,129] sys_var_init_flag local vars.
* sprite shift pts, ctrl pt for ellipse/polygon w,h is off when rotated.

* Window mgr needs to do DOC operations on posted messages from mouse.  Works for [C:/TempleOS/Kernel/KbdMouse/InputPointer.CPP.Z,74] SetIP(), though.

* Add local vars to sym table in [C:/TempleOS/Kernel/Dbg1a.CPP.Z,691] Dbg()?  (maybe)

* Demo [C:/TempleOS/Adam/ToHtml.CPP.Z,318] ToHtml().

* Del short name in FAT32--currently I do not check to see if I have generated a unique short name and one can delete multiple files accidentally.  Generating unique short names is a pain in the ass because you have to scan the whole directory.  I think I just truncate the name instead of "Program~1" or whatever. S081130-0001.BMP crashed windows--two identical short names.

* OVERSTRIKE at cmd line with menu macro.

* puts3 with depth buf?  might not do this
* make task queins and querem safe for multicore cycling through tasks (fwd).
* make better heapwalk, do something with _CFG_HEAP_DBG.
* log to file--would be inefficient--load-in whole file, modify and write out.  Useful, but not very efficient  (TempleOS file system has no grow-file ability.  Created when FAT patent was an issue and wanted absly nothing people could sue me for.)
* APIC2
* import intel datasheets, somehow?
* Get better dictionary, good spell checker.
* WordStat/Man Jmp for user code.
* Might make DskView show drive colors.

* Too much preemption turned off?
* Look for mem leaks.
* Move stuff out of Kernel module.

* do r,rm ICCmp like ICBrCmp
* could make glblvar imports use TY_RIP_DISP32.
* PUSH_CMP allocs reg R9 or whatever
* Might be problem with NOP in OPT pass1 for NO_PUSH in expressions besides assignments.  Is ShiftNoPush fully implemented?
* NOP1 might need to have diff ic_data's
* in divequal, it assumes about ebx
* error/warning line nums
* ASM branch out warning of range off by 1 line--use lx->last_line_num

* Switch statement with sparse cases (low priority)
* maybe inline functions?
* Use of more floating-point stk?

* More aggressive in this routine [C:/TempleOS/Compiler/OptPass3.CPP.Z,27] CmpF2PushPop() with types besides MOV and F64. 
* !dbl ~dbl
* &=, |= can overflow with Bts Btr on small data types

* num lock comes on with break key
