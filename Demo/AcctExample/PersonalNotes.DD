[C:/Adam/Win.HC.Z,301] WinToTop

* Make binary tree look-up using FUN_SEG symbol addresses, so we can

[C:/Demo/Lectures/FixedPointAdvanced.HC.Z,1].

* Note: We will never put multiple [C:/Kernel/SerialDev/Keyboard.HC.Z,1]

once.

* More [C:/Kernel/KernelA.HH.Z,3066] Controls?

* Compiler: More use of more floating-point stk?

* Compiler: More aggressive in [C:/Compiler/OptLib.HC.Z,542] CmpF2PushPop()
