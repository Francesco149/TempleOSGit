* Clean-up [C:/Kernel/Dsk/DskStr.CPP.Z,207] FileNameAbs().

* Get rid of having two terms and pick one, "Disk" and "BlkDev"?  I don't 
think so.  (Probably not.)

* God said this is bad.  [C:/Adam/DolDoc/DocFind.CPP.Z,41]

* [C:/Adam/Dsk/ChkDsk.CPP.Z,204] ChkDsk alloc unalloced.

* Add change-triangle-color to mesh editor.

* Add AVL binary tree support or red/black whatever that is.  We have 
fixed-size stack.  Auto-balancing binary tree is very needed.  Where could we 
use?

* Maybe let committee decide if we want intern to make binary tree look-up 
using PSECT symbol addresses, so we can eliminate psect cache and wall-paper 
kludge.  All HolyC functions and glbl vars would have left-right for address 
search.

* QEMU [C:/Kernel/KMisc.CPP.Z,122] tS real-time-clock, slow Wenceslas.

* Is "GrSetSymmetry" or "GrSymmetry" better?

* DCF_TRANSFORMATION|DCF_SYMMETRY|DCF_JUST_MIRROR -- maybe not both needed at 
once.

* $CM+LE+RE is nasty

* FlatTop is torpedo, not bombs.
* BomberGolf is weird concept?

$=-CTASK_NEG_OFFSET
offset(CTask.addr)==0
Spawn(): CAlloc()

Looks like task_flags,locked_flags cause problems with neg offset.
---------------------

* 3/19/14: RESET during RawHide
* 2013? Wenceslas in TestSuite crashes, long time ago

* 12/26/13: Mountain in TestSuite didn't run right.  Turned yellow, did 
nothing.

* FAQ frontloaded

* # in reindention

* HexEdit with odd size, ASCII cannot be edited.

* clean-up addDev pmt

* Might want to convert some Preempt() to Cli

* [C:/Adam/DolDoc/DocMain.CPP.Z,48] Plain() might be better not saving
[C:/Kernel/KernelA.HPP.Z,3409] CH_CURSOR.

* TRANSPARENT might not work with line ROPF_DITHER

* It would be nice if [C:/Compiler/UAsm.CPP.Z,640] U() NOP were better.

* unhandled exception on MP message gets overwritten by WinMgr

* Cmd to enable/disable compiler warnings

* What if we had a type for either F64 or I64, like Print -- no conversion.
* What if we had a ... that did do conversion, if we have one that doesn't.

* fix documentation problem -- remembering 0 terminator in str or not for $DA
* GetS, crazy putkey code
* editor page formatting is FUBAR

* GrEdit: Move sidebar selected elems.
	- Be careful of multipt elems.
* GrEdit: Strip origin shift cmds.

* GrEditBitMap, grabscroll? 

* extern of fun with dft arg of str?

* We kinda need a routine to return how much free memory,
so that applications can plan a big alloc.

* FileMgr bad with lots of files.  

* This [C:/Kernel/SrvCmd.CPP.Z,1] Fs->catch_except=TRUE causes problems
because it
catches divide and out-of-mem.  Not sure what to do, yet.

* Make [C:/Kernel/MultiProc.CPP.Z,302] BSPStartMP() start work after boot to
reset multicores.  Bonus for
freeing old task memory. (Prolly never gonna do anything about this.)

* [C:/Kernel/KernelB.HPP.Z,146] sys_var_init_flag local vars.
* sprite shift pts, ctrl pt for ellipse/polygon w,h is off when rotated.

* Window mgr needs to do DOC operations on posted messages from mouse.
Works for [C:/Kernel/KbdMouse/InputPointer.CPP.Z,43] IPSet(), though.

* Add local vars to sym table in [C:/Kernel/KDbg.CPP.Z,637] Dbg()?  (maybe)

* [C:/Adam/DolDoc/DocRecalcB.CPP.Z,1] Bible sized nodes
* Mouseinstall throws exceptions, doesn't work, investigate Mouse
[C:/Kernel/KbdMouse/Mouse.CPP.Z,1] 0x9FC30
* get kbd lights working.
* Might have issue with compiler exceptions and restoring lex.hash tables.
* Generates two compiler error messages for expressions in statements.
* release semaphores or break lock sema,usb_td
* Fix Mom's secondary CD-ROM, dad's primary
* pmtstr in install didn't like focus change

*U0 Main()
{
  U0 (*fp_old_draw_input_ptr)(CDC *dc,I64 x,I64 y)=gr.fp_draw_input_ptr;
}

* What about local variable array/struct initialization.

* Demo [C:/Adam/Utils/ToHtml.CPP.Z,280] ToHtml().

* Del short name in FAT32--currently I do not check to see if I have generated
a unique short name and one can delete multiple files accidentally.
Generating unique short names is a pain in the ass because you have to scan
the whole directory.  I think I just truncate the name instead of
"Program~1" or whatever.  S081130-0001.BMP crashed windows--two identical
short names.

* OVERSTRIKE at cmd line with menu macro.

* lock{} warning on invalid modes.
* Local array vars-->reg.
* [C:/Kernel/KernelA.HPP.Z,3525] DCF_SYMMETRY, before transformation?

* compiler F32
* preempt(OFF) during graphic clipping?
* compiler optimization heap_glbls with added offset
* Might make FAT32 read in contiguous chunks.
* make Clamp(),Min(),Max() asm routines.
* Might make CSprite flood fill operate on a separate bitmap
and blotted at the end.
* autofile popup of popup
* <CTRL-r> delete subsprite in menu near others
* consider changing domenu so a real <ESC> on menu item doesn't select
(<SPACE> sends <ESC> followed by <SPACE> or something)
* puts3 with depth buf?  might not do this
* make task queins and querem safe for multicore cycling through tasks (fwd).
* make better heapwalk, do something with _CFG_HEAP_DBG.
* log to file--would be inefficient--load-in whole file, modify and write out.
Useful, but not very efficient  (TempleOS file system has no grow-file 
ability.
Created when FAT patent was an issue and wanted absly nothing people could sue
me for.)
* APIC2
* import intel datasheets, somehow?
* Get better dictionary, good spell checker.
* AutoComplete/Man Jmp for user code.
* Might make DskView show drive colors.
* Might do utility to set drive colors, making a tree entry in Adam 3 using
registry-like routines... or registry I guess.

* New Editor widgets

* Make use of flag potential in SysFilesFind and possibly CFileAccess
* implement fixed pos files

* new HolyC language features
* better debugging

* Too much preemption turned off?
* Look for mem leaks.
* Move stuff out of Kernel module.

* [C:/Kernel/KernelA.HPP.Z,2831] ROP_XOR with pen_width>1 is broken.

* use width and height in line clipping for pen_width>1 or blot.
* SIMD transformation
* test removable media id  (critical for resident files)

* add field overflow U8 "t='*'"
* Implement fmt codes into Get
* Date Input
* Default date fmt

* 16 bit Unassembly is bad--very low priority
* more signed int disassembly
* support r4u8 by adding 0x40 byte
* static var off of data heap.
* Might want to use U32*U32 multiplication.
* could add "const" to not set LF_NOT_CONST flag for trig, etc.
* do r,rm ICCmp like ICBrCmp
* could make glblvar imports use TY_RIP_DISP32.
* PUSH_CMP allocs reg R9 or whatever
* Might be problem with NOP in OPT pass1 for NO_PUSH in expressions besides
assignments.  Is ShiftNoPush fully implemented?
* NOP1 might need to have diff ic_data's
* in divequal, it assumes about ebx
* error/warning line nums
* ASM branch out warning of range off by 1 line--use lx->last_line_num

* Switch statement with sparse cases (low priority)
* maybe inline functions?
* Use of more floating-point stk?

* More aggressive in this routine [C:/Compiler/OptLib.CPP.Z,533]
CmpF2PushPop() with types besides MOV and 
F64. 
* !dbl ~dbl
* &=, |= can overflow with Bts Btr on small data types

* num lock comes on with break key
* sort options for findfiles
* Maybe, get rid of [C:/Compiler/CMain.CPP.Z,1] 0x20000 in compiler.

This is the transcript of a radio conversation of a US naval ship with 
Canadian authorities off the coast of Newfoundland in October, 1995. Radio 
conversation released by the Chief of Naval Operations 10-10-95.

                Americans: Please divert your course 15 degrees to the North 
to avoid a Collision.

                Canadians: Recommend you divert YOUR course 15 degrees to the 
South to avoid a collision.

                Americans: This is the Captain of a US Navy ship. I say
again, 
divert YOUR course.

                Canadians: No. I say again, you divert YOUR course.

                Americans: This is the aircraft carrier USS Lincoln, the 
second largest ship in the United States' Atlantic fleet. We are accompanied 
by three destroyers, three cruisers and numerous support vessels. I demand 
that YOU change your course 15 degrees north, that's one five degrees north, 
or countermeasures will be undertaken to ensure the safety of this ship.

                Canadians: This is a lighthouse. Your call.[2]
