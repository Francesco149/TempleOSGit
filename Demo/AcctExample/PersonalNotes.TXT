* [C:/Adam/ABlkDev/FileMgr.CPP.Z,545] FileMgr() is bad with lots of files.  

* Would be nice to have a routine telling how much free memory, so apps can 
plan a big alloc.  This is doable, depending on how.

* 1/28/16 [C:/Demo/Graphics/Pick3D.CPP.Z,1] crashed in TestSuite.

* 1/12/16 make RAM drive 2288 blks, CopyTree("C:/Home","B:/Home");   Disk 
runs-out of space and hangs instead of reporting errors.

* Bug introduced around 11/1/15.  Changed [C:/Kernel/Sched.CPP.Z,1] and now 
[C:/Adam/WinA.CPP.Z,279] WinToTop is called on Adam task at start-up,
sometimes.  Might be user's fault 
because of bad keys pressed during VMware power-on init.  Might be fixed by

* 1/12/16 [C:/Kernel/BlkDev/DskATAId.CPP.Z,91] ATARepEntry shows corrupted

* VMware: Stretch to full screen
* VMware: PC speaker sound distorted.

testsuite.  Perhaps, floodfill?
* 3/19/14: RESET during RawHide. 

* [C:/Adam/ABlkDev/ChkDsk.CPP.Z,207] ChkDsk alloc unalloced.  I don't know if
I fixed this.

* 1/?/2015,8/10/2015 Macro select in Menu did not go to shell?  No, I think 
just <CTRL-m> twice.  Not a bug.

* 5/7/14:Something like [C:/Adam/AutoFile.CPP.Z,117] AFSetIP caused hang,
then reboot in TestSuite.

* Clean-up code [C:/Kernel/BlkDev/DskStrA.CPP.Z,161] FileNameAbs(), does it
need so many local var names?  I guess 
no choice.


                               Committee Needed
* Make binary tree look-up using FUN_SEG symbol addresses, so we can
eliminate 
fun_seg cache and wall-paper kludge?  All HolyC functions and glbl vars would 
have left-right for address search.

* Improve editor undo, add redo.

* Compiler: F32?

* International Date output: [C:/Kernel/StrPrint.CPP.Z,62] MPrintDate(). 
Every country make own version?

* [C:/Adam/WinB.CPP.Z,421] WinMgrTask needs to do doc operations on
[C:/Kernel/SrvCmd.CPP.Z,240] PostMsg() msgs for mouse.  Already 
works for [C:/Kernel/SerialDev/InputPointer.CPP.Z,43] IPSet()?

* Should Msgs in PopUp queue get fwded to parent when task dies?

* Import Intel datasheets so we can use links in
[C:/Kernel/Mem/PageTables.CPP.Z,1] Code for documentation.  I 
tried a PDF-to-text convertor and it wasn't acceptible.

* Why are BMP file [C:/Kernel/KernelA.HPP.Z,2986] CBGR24's wrong? 
[C:/Adam/Opt/Utils/FileBMP.CPP.Z,1].

* Switch stmt with sparse cases?  Maybe, ban sparse switch stmts.

* Compiler Optimization: Postpone LocalVar init until last possible moment in 
case of return.

* Compiler: Local var array/struct initialization.

* Compiler Optimization: Bools use r,rm in [C:/Compiler/BackB.CPP.Z,102]
ICCmp() like in [C:/Compiler/BackB.CPP.Z,468] ICCmpAndBranch()?

* Compiler: !F64 ~F64

also?

* Compiler: [C:/Kernel/KernelB.HPP.Z,186] sys_var_init_flag for local vars?

* Implement [C:/Kernel/KernelA.HPP.Z,2538] RS_ATTR_FIXED fixed pos files?

* Editor page formatting is FUBAR.

* SIMD in [C:/Adam/Gr/GrDC.CPP.Z,6] Mat4x4MulXYZ?

* I use fixed-point in [C:/Adam/Gr/GrMath.CPP.Z,288] Circle(),

Mat4x4MulXYZ(), 
[C:/Adam/Gr/GrMath.CPP.Z,99] Mat4x4MulMat4x4New() and others.  God says I
might want to change to float.  
[C:/Demo/Lectures/FixedPoint.CPP.Z,1]
[C:/Demo/Lectures/FixedPointAdvanced.CPP.Z,1].

* Note: We will never put multiple [C:/Kernel/SerialDev/Keyboard.CPP.Z,1]
Keyboard Tables.  Each country must make 
their own version of TempleOS.  The [C:/Doc/Demands.TXT.Z,1] Intel Factory
ROM will have just English.  
Our [C:/Doc/Charter.TXT.Z,1] Charter bans multiple country or architectures
in the same version.

* We are not doing UTF, but we will add cyrillic 8-bit Russian font on 
aux_font. <CTRL-ALT-f> will toggle fonts.  Or, we will redefine upper 128-255 
ASCII characters and move 12 border chars to screen font codes 0-26?  
[C:/Adam/Gr/GrTextBase.CPP.Z,329] TextBorder() [C:/Kernel/KDbg.CPP.Z,291]
RawDr().  Add aux_font option with [C:/Kernel/StrA.CPP.Z,325] chars_bmp_alpha
configured for 
any aux_font?


                             Inspirational Ideas
* Redo videos, make more professional.

* Use standard terminology from "the literature".

* Striped and other dither patterns.  Brushes?

* Get rid of BYTE, WORD, DWORD in opcode and replace with U8, U16, U32.

* Get rid of having two terms and pick one, "Disk" and "BlkDev"?  (Probably, 
not that one.)

* Could switch to having just C and D drives and RAMDrive and CD/DVD? 

* New editor widgets.

* Make use of flag potential in [C:/Kernel/BlkDev/DskFind.CPP.Z,30]
FilesFind() and possibly [C:/Kernel/BlkDev/DskDirContext.CPP.Z,21]
DirContextNew().
* Sort options for [C:/Kernel/BlkDev/DskFind.CPP.Z,30] FilesFind()?

* $LK,L="FL:D:/Kernel/File.CPP"$ instead of A=
* $SP,B=1$ instead of $SP,BI=1$
* $CM+LE+RE is nasty

* DCF_TRANSFORMATION|DCF_SYMMETRY|DCF_JUST_MIRROR -- maybe not both needed at 
once.

* More [C:/Kernel/KernelA.HPP.Z,3110] Controls?

* Compiler: More use of more floating-point stk?

* Compiler: More aggressive in [C:/Compiler/OptLib.CPP.Z,542] CmpF2PushPop()
with types besides MOV and F64. 

* Playing with [C:/Demo/Lectures/NegDisp.CPP.Z,1] on
[C:/Kernel/KernelA.HPP.Z,3317] CTask?
     $=-CTASK_NEG_OFFSET
offset(CTask.addr)==0
Spawn(): CAlloc()
TaskDel(): Free()
CSysFixedArea.adam
Looks like task_flags,locked_flags cause problems with neg offset.

* Make a game, S.E.T.I., with radio telescope array.  Put God on air.
