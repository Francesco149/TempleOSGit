* Redo videos, make more professional.

* Nontimer [C:/Kernel/KMathB.CPP.Z,122] Rand() is really bad!

* Investigate why packet loss [C:/Adam/Training.CPP.Z,1] Training Sleep(1).

* Add AVL binary tree support or red/black whatever that is.  We have 
fixed-size stack.  Auto-balancing binary tree is very needed.  I've done 
everything myself.  I don't want to ruin a perfect record.  I'm in no hurry.

* 8/20/2015 TAD8, Tour TestSuite was missing #include "TestSuite".
* 1/03/2016 TAD8 Repeated

* Bug introduced around 11/1/15.  Changed [C:/Kernel/Sched.CPP.Z,1] and now

CounterRenaissance "Rennaisance"
* 01/06/2016 Editor filter "str" applied to output from LineRep looks broken.

* Get rid of having two terms and pick one, "Disk" and "BlkDev"?  I don't 
think so.  (Probably not.)

* God said this is bad.  [C:/Adam/DolDoc/DocFind.CPP.Z,41]

* [C:/Adam/ABlkDev/ChkDsk.CPP.Z,207] ChkDsk alloc unalloced.

* Should we switch to having just C and D drives (and RAM and CD/DVD)?

* Entering a '$' in $TX command's tag

* Should these be moved into [C:/Kernel/KernelA.HPP.Z,826] CHashClass from
[C:/Kernel/KernelA.HPP.Z,790] CMemberLst and [C:/Kernel/KernelA.HPP.Z,866]
CHashGlblVar?
  CArrayDim dim;
  CHashFun *fun_ptr;

* Might want to warn switch() dup case numbers

* Add cyrillic 8-bit Russian font on aux_font? <CTRL-ALT-f> will toggle fonts.
  Move 12 border chars to screen font codes 0-26? 
[C:/Adam/Gr/GrTextBase.CPP.Z,329] TextBorder() [C:/Kernel/KDbg.CPP.Z,291]
RawDr().
  Add aux_font option with [C:/Kernel/StrA.CPP.Z,325] chars_bmp_alpha
configured for any aux_font?

* Should we rename chars_bmp_ to set_

* Use standard terminology from "the literature".

* Clean-up ASCII #127 delete char?  (No. Maybe, we want a new usage for 127
in 
future centuries.)

* [C:/Kernel/StrPrint.CPP.Z,218] StrPrintJoin(,st); With st="\n\\"; (I forgot
what this is talking about.)

* 8/2/2015 VMware start-up. Probably multicore.
* [C:/Kernel/SerialDev/Keyboard.CPP.Z,1] CtrlAltDel on <CTRL-ALT-INS> 
Probably, VMware bug.

* 1/1/2015 Bug messing-up keyboard, like no CTRL key.  Was working on Sprites.

* 1/?/2015,8/10/2015 Macro select in Menu did not go to shell.  No: I think 
CTRL-M twice.  (Probably, fixed or not a bug.)

* [C:/Adam/Opt/Utils/FileBMP.CPP.Z,65] BMPRLE4To() has files_size too big by
108.  Did I fix it?

"DN:word"

* Cannot include ':' in [C:/Adam/DolDoc/DocLink.CPP.Z,1] Document Links
search string.

* PSect does not scan all task tables.
* [C:/Home/HomeWrappers.CPP.Z,13] R("PSect","Fun-something"); ?
* Maybe let committee decide if we want intern to make binary tree look-up 
using PSECT symbol addresses, so we can eliminate psect cache and wall-paper 
kludge.  All HolyC functions and glbl vars would have left-right for address 
search.


* I think subswitch_start with a break in the preface fails.

* Do [C:/Kernel/KernelA.HPP.Z,3268] CTask->task_flags need to be in separate
cache lines?

* Add DeleteHidden checkbox to <CTRL-F> Filter.

* Add change-triangle-color to mesh editor.
* Add 3D-Mesh Editor make-prism.

* DCF_TRANSFORMATION|DCF_SYMMETRY|DCF_JUST_MIRROR -- maybe not both needed at 
once.

* DiskCache during FileRead. <CTRL-ALT-C>, [C:/Kernel/KTask.CPP.Z,28] Kill().
 

* Get rid of BYTE WORD DWORD in opcode and replace with U8 U16 U32.

* 5/7/14:Something like AFSetIP.CPP caused hang, then reboot in TestSuite.
* 5/7/14:#63 Maybe, [C:/Demo/Graphics/Pick3D.CPP.Z,1] crashed in TestSuite.
* 6/8/14:After or in PageEntries2 in TestSuite crash.

* $LK,L="FL:D:/Kernel/File.CPP"$ instead of A=
* $SP,B=1$ instead of $SP,BI=1$
* $CM+LE+RE is nasty

* FlatTop is torpedo, not bombs.

* Maybe, 3x3 instead of 4x4 matrices. <sigh>

* Get rid of text background color.

* Make a game, S.E.T.I., with radio telescope array.  Put God on air. 

* [C:/Adam/Opt/Utils/Diff.CPP.Z,237] Diff() flags.

* Backward SHIFT-F3 is broken

EADDqACB3e2G3GDGqDeEADDqACB"


* [C:/Kernel/Mem/MemPhysical.CPP.Z,91] Mem32DevAlloc() is broken. Devices
should be in free spot of E820 report.

* SPRITES in CMD Line code.

* Might want to move kernel code out of low 2Meg.  Might be faster.

* 4/13/14 Strut or RawHide crashed when sys_var_init_flag etc
was set during testsuite.

* Bible ranges. 
* No way to clear +Hold entries

---------------------
$=-CTASK_NEG_OFFSET
offset(CTask.addr)==0
Spawn(): CAlloc()
TaskFinishOff(): Free()
CSysFixedArea.adam
Looks like task_flags,locked_flags cause problems with neg offset.
---------------------

* 3/19/14: RESET during RawHide

* FAQ frontloaded

COMPILER
  * Postpone LocalVar Init until last possible moment. (in case RETURN)

God says I might want to change to float. 
[C:/Demo/Lectures/FixedPoint.CPP.Z,1].

* DOCF_DBL_DOLLARS in reindention

* HexEdit with odd size, ASCII cannot be edited.

* clean-up addDev pmt

* [C:/Adam/DolDoc/DocEd.CPP.Z,233] Plain() might be better not saving
[C:/Kernel/KernelA.HPP.Z,3461] CH_CURSOR.

* TRANSPARENT might not work with line ROPF_DITHER

* It would be nice if [C:/Compiler/UAsm.CPP.Z,649] U() NOP were better.

* unhandled exception on MP message gets overwritten by WinMgr

* Cmd to enable/disable compiler warnings

* What if we had a type for either F64 or I64, like Print -- no conversion.
* What if we had a ... that did do conversion, if we have one that doesn't.

* fix documentation problem -- remembering 0 terminator in str or not for $DA
* GetS, crazy putkey code
* editor page formatting is FUBAR

* [C:/Adam/Gr/GrGlbls.CPP.Z,3] gr.screen_image

* GrEdit: Move sidebar selected elems.
	- Be careful of multipt elems.
* GrEdit: Strip origin shift cmds.

* GrEditBitMap, grabscroll? 

* extern of fun with dft arg of str?

* We kinda need a routine to return how much free memory,
so that applications can plan a big alloc.

* FileMgr bad with lots of files.  

* This [C:/Kernel/SrvCmd.CPP.Z,1] Fs->catch_except=TRUE causes problems
because it
catches divide and out-of-mem.  Not sure what to do, yet.

* Make [C:/Kernel/MultiProc.CPP.Z,301] Core0StartMP() start work after boot
to reset multicores.  Bonus for
freeing old task memory. (Prolly never gonna do anything about this.)

* [C:/Kernel/KernelB.HPP.Z,191] sys_var_init_flag local vars.
* sprite shift pts, ctrl pt for ellipse/polygon w,h is off when rotated.

* Window mgr needs to do DOC operations on posted messages from mouse.
Works for [C:/Kernel/SerialDev/InputPointer.CPP.Z,43] IPSet(), though.

* Add local vars to sym table in [C:/Kernel/KDbg.CPP.Z,636] Dbg()?  (maybe)

* [C:/Adam/DolDoc/DocRecalc.CPP.Z,1] Bible sized nodes
* Mouseinstall throws exceptions, doesn't work, investigate Mouse
[C:/Kernel/SerialDev/Mouse.CPP.Z,1] 0x9FC30
* get kbd lights working.
* Might have issue with compiler exceptions and restoring lex.hash tables.
* Generates two compiler error messages for expressions in statements.
* release semaphores or break lock sema,usb_td
* Fix Mom's secondary CD/DVD, dad's primary
* pmtstr in install didn't like focus change

*U0 Main()
{
  U0 (*fp_old_draw_input_ptr)(CDC *dc,I64 x,I64 y)=gr.fp_draw_input_ptr;
}

* What about local variable array/struct initialization.

* Demo [C:/Adam/Opt/Utils/ToHtml.CPP.Z,300] ToHtml().

* Del short name in FAT32--currently I do not check to see if I have generated
a unique short name and one can delete multiple files accidentally.
Generating unique short names is a pain in the ass because you have to scan
the whole directory.  I think I just truncate the name instead of
"Program~1" or whatever.  S081130-0001.BMP crashed windows--two identical
short names.

* OVERSTRIKE at cmd line with menu macro.

* lock{} warning on invalid modes.
* Local array vars-->reg.
* [C:/Kernel/KernelA.HPP.Z,3580] DCF_SYMMETRY, before transformation?

* Maybe convert graphics to float
* Warn unnecessary typecast
* compiler F32
* compiler optimization heap_glbls with added offset
* Might make FAT32 read in contiguous chunks.
* make Clamp(),Min(),Max() asm routines.
* Might make CSprite flood fill operate on a separate bitmap
and blotted at the end.
* autofile popup of popup
* <CTRL-r> delete subsprite in menu near others
* consider changing domenu so a real <ESC> on menu item doesn't select
(<SPACE> sends <ESC> followed by <SPACE> or something)
* puts3 with depth buf?  might not do this
* make task queins and querem safe for multicore cycling through tasks (fwd).
* make better heapwalk, do something with _CFG_HEAP_DBG.
* log to file--would be inefficient--load-in whole file, modify and write out.
Useful, but not very efficient  (TempleOS file system has no grow-file 
ability.
Created when FAT patent was an issue and wanted absly nothing people could sue
me for.)
* APIC2
* import intel datasheets, somehow?
* Get better dictionary, good spell checker.
* AutoComplete/Man Jmp for user code.
* Might make DskView show drive colors.
* Might do utility to set drive colors, making a tree entry in Adam 3 using
registry-like routines... or registry I guess.

* New Editor widgets

* Make use of flag potential in [C:/Kernel/BlkDev/DskFind.CPP.Z,30]
FilesFind() and possibly [C:/Kernel/BlkDev/DskDirContext.CPP.Z,21]
DirContextNew()
* implement fixed pos files

* new HolyC language features
* better debugging

* Look for mem leaks.
* Move stuff out of Kernel module.

* [C:/Kernel/KernelA.HPP.Z,2894] ROP_XOR with pen_width>1 is broken.
* BGR wrong in BMP files.

* use width and height in line clipping for pen_width>1 or blot.
* SIMD transformation
* test removable media id  (critical for resident files)

* add field overflow U8 "t='*'"
* Implement fmt codes into Get
* Date Input
* Default date fmt

* 16 bit Unassembly is bad--very low priority
* more signed int disassembly
* support r4u8 by adding 0x40 byte
* static var off of data heap.
* Might want to use U32*U32 multiplication.
* could add "const" to not set CCF_NOT_CONST flag for trig, etc.
* do r,rm ICCmp like ICBrCmp
* could make glblvar imports use TY_RIP_DISP32.
* PUSH_CMP allocs reg R9 or whatever
* Might be problem with NOP in OPT pass1 for NO_PUSH in expressions besides
assignments.  Is ShiftNoPush fully implemented?
* NOP1 might need to have diff ic_data's
* in divequal, it assumes about ebx
* error/warning line nums
* ASM branch out warning of range off by 1 line--use cc->last_line_num

* [C:/Adam/AHash.CPP.Z,149] Who("-r"); Capital r is strongly desired.

* Switch statement with sparse cases (low priority)
* maybe inline functions?
* Use of more floating-point stk?

* More aggressive in this routine [C:/Compiler/OptLib.CPP.Z,536]
CmpF2PushPop() with types besides MOV and 
F64. 
* !dbl ~dbl
* &=, |= can overflow with Bts Btr on small data types

* num lock comes on with break key
* sort options for findfiles
* Maybe, get rid of [C:/Compiler/CMain.CPP.Z,1] 0x20000 in compiler.

============================ Possible Things to Eliminate
