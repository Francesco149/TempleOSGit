                             Inspirational Ideas
* Use standard terminology from "the literature".

* Get rid of BYTE, WORD, DWORD in opcode and replace with U8, U16, U32.

* Get rid of "Char".

* Get rid of having two terms and pick one, "Disk" and "BlkDev"?  (Probably, 
not that one.)

* Could switch to having just C and D drives and RAMDrive and CD/DVD? 

* New editor widgets.

* Make use of flag potential in [C:/Kernel/BlkDev/DskFind.CPP.Z,30]
FilesFind() and possibly [C:/Kernel/BlkDev/DskDirContext.CPP.Z,21]
DirContextNew().
* Sort options for [C:/Kernel/BlkDev/DskFind.CPP.Z,30] FilesFind()?

* New [C:/Doc/HolyC.TXT.Z,1] HolyC language features?

* Better [Debugging,1] Debugging?

* Look for mem leaks?

* Std local var names.

* Move stuff out of [C:/Kernel/Kernel.PRJ.Z,1] Kernel module.

* $LK,L="FL:D:/Kernel/File.CPP"$ instead of A=
* $SP,B=1$ instead of $SP,BI=1$
* $CM+LE+RE is nasty

* DCF_TRANSFORMATION|DCF_SYMMETRY|DCF_JUST_MIRROR -- maybe not both needed at 
once.

* More [C:/Kernel/KernelA.HPP.Z,3062] Controls?

* Playing with [C:/Demo/Lectures/NegDisp.CPP.Z,1] on

     $=-CTASK_NEG_OFFSET
offset(CTask.addr)==0
