/*
This demonstrates dynamic initialization of
vars.  It even works for AOT modules
because code is generated which runs at
[C:/Kernel/Hash1b.CPP.Z,359] Load() time to initialize them.

This file is dual use -- you can JIT compile
it or AOT compile it.  If you AOT compile
then override the filename extension warning.

Static vars are, essentually, global var.

Now, we'll use the data heap glbl option
to force global vars onto the data heap.
You can't initialize heap glbls in a AOT
module.

You can turn the data heap flag
on and off within your programs, leaving
ones which need initialization on the code heap.

You can't dynamically initialize data heap
glbls--they are consts.  This might be a silly
point, but might result in odd differences, perhaps
from the order things are evaluated.

Data heap glbls are good for AOT modules
because they don't take-up room in the .BIN.Z file.
