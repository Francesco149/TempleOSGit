14:30 A sound heart is the life of the flesh: but envy the rottenness
of the bones.

14:31 He that oppresseth the poor reproacheth his Maker: but he that
honoureth him hath mercy on the poor.

14:32 The wicked is driven away in his wickedness: but the righteous
hath hope in his death.

14:33 Wisdom resteth in the heart of him that hath understanding: but
that which is in the midst of fools is made known.

14:34 Righteousness exalteth a nation: but sin is a reproach to any
people.

against him that causeth shame.

Do You like "To a Waterfowl", God?

To a Waterfowl;
by William Cullen Bryant

Whither, 'midst falling dew,
While glow the heavens with the last steps of day,
Far, through their rosy depths, dost thou pursue
Thy solitary way?

Vainly the fowler's eye
Might mark thy distant flight to do thee wrong,
As, darkly painted on the crimson sky,
Thy figure floats along.

Seek'st thou the plashy brink
Of weedy lake, or marge of river wide,
Or where the rocking billows rise and sink
On the chafed ocean side?

There is a Power whose care
Teaches thy way along that pathless coast,--
The desert and illimitable air,--
Lone wandering, but not lost.

All day thy wings have fann'd
At that far height, the cold thin atmosphere:
Yet stoop not, weary, to the welcome land,
Though the dark night is near.

And soon that toil shall end,
Soon shalt thou find a summer home, and rest,
And scream among thy fellows; reed shall bend
Soon o'er thy sheltered nest.

Thou'rt gone, the abyss of heaven
Hath swallowed up thy form; yet, on my heart
Deeply hath sunk the lesson thou hast given,
And shall not soon depart.

He, who, from zone to zone,
Guides through the boundless sky thy certain flight,
In the long way that I must tread alone,
Will lead my steps aright.


Do You like that, God?

When it comes to native installs, I'm not sure what percentage of systems.  I 
could make a wild guess -- 30%?  You have to know the ATA/ATAPI port 
addresses.

PCI devices add a bunch of lines of code and work on only a miniscule number 
of machines because you have to identify the device, handle all the different 
controllers and get right the interrupts and bunches of other shit.  

Since you only get it working on a handful of PCI systems, you get no added

sound AND bad sound.  Fuck that, just do bad sound.  Fuck PCI.

My first lesson in PC hardware:  I did an ATA PIO driver.  I learned my drive 
or controller would not do READ, just MULTI_READ.  Yer kidding me!  Now, I do 
MULTI_READ and pray nobody want just READ.  I write one block at a time, I 
think, I don't remember.  Doing just one block is the safest.  The kids will 
probably do the max their controller will handle.  They are completely 
clueless that a different computer probably will not work.  They will be 
really cocky, too.  They like to brag about their graphics.  What good is one 
GPU driver, that probably only works for that particular GPU under special 
circumstances?

There's all kinds of crazy shit.  The CDROM boot will read up to 4 CDROM 
blocks on ... a computer I had.  Otherwise, I might have done a 2 (3) stage 
loader instead of 3 (4).  My bootloader is in a block.  It loads my 200K 
kernel which loads the rest.  If the CDROM boot block count was better, I 
could have loaded my 200K kernel right away, instead of making a boot block 
loader.

Basically, PC hardware is clusterfucked and the fewer assumptions you make
the 
better.

of God was, and Samuel was laid down to sleep; 3:4 That the LORD

So, once everybody knows about God and He claims this as His temple, people 
will gather with this temple as a focus point for offerings and responses.  
What was the purpose of the original temple?  It was a community center.

enlightened 
on why it's a relief -- only 16 colors to worry about.

I wish to get other people involved.  Normally, committees fuck things up,

I think mine is unfuck-up-able if I impose a 100,000 line of code limit for 
all time.  It is critical for people to see the light at the end of the

when it comes to the size of this thing.

It is currently 81,500 lines of code.  We can expand up to 100,000.  Code 
comments would be nice.  What else does the committee want?  FTP?

We are not doing a browser.  We don't want to be redundant to Windows.  This 
is a creator paradise, not consumer.  You create offerings of art, poem, 
comics, hymns or games.

KingJamesBible (Deuteronomy 24:12) God says...
24:12 And if the man be poor, thou shalt not sleep with his pledge:
24:13 In any case thou shalt deliver him the pledge again when the sun
goeth down, that he may sleep in his own raiment, and bless thee: and
it shall be righteousness unto thee before the LORD thy God.

24:14 Thou shalt not oppress an hired servant that is poor and needy,
whether he be of thy brethren, or of thy strangers that are in thy
land within thy gates: 24:15 At his day thou shalt give him his hire,
neither shall the sun go down upon it; for he is poor, and setteth his
heart upon it: lest he cry against thee unto the LORD, and it be sin
unto thee.

24:16 The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, neither
shall the children be put to death for the fathers: every man shall be
put to death for his own sin.

24:17 Thou shalt not pervert the judgment of the stranger, nor of the
fatherless; nor take a widow's raiment to pledge: 24:18 But thou shalt
remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt, and the LORD thy God
redeemed thee thence: therefore I command thee to do this thing.

5 sigma.  Technically, you only have to prove God once, if it really is
proof. 
 He doesn't go away.  He could talk once every thousand years.  If SETI got a 
message every thousand years... nobody would believe.  LOL  Everybody's a 
fucken nigger.

You cannot explain to a nigger that you only have to prove God once, if it is 
science.  Maybe, twice?  If you ever reach pure logic, you prove God just 
once.

This is funny: "Obviously, you cannot prove or disprove God."

upon the horns of your altars; 17:2 Whilst their children remember
their altars and their groves by the green trees upon the high hills.

17:3 O my mountain in the field, I will give thy substance and all thy
treasures to the spoil, and thy high places for sin, throughout all
thy borders.

17:4 And thou, even thyself, shalt discontinue from thine heritage
that I gave thee; and I will cause thee to serve thine enemies in the
land which thou knowest not: for ye have kindled a fire in mine anger,
which shall burn for ever.

maketh flesh his arm, and whose heart departeth from the LORD.

17:6 For he shall be like the heath in the desert, and shall not see
when good cometh; but shall inhabit the parched places in the
wilderness, in a salt land and not inhabited.

say anything unless it is witty.  I think it might be book-smart people smart

is delightful and witty and riddlish.  That means no useful normal 
conversation happens, LOL.  Oh well.

This would never work:

"Hey God, what do You think of abortion?"

That is too direct.  You could get an answer if you did an offering, first.  
His answers are frustratingly schroidingerish, or something,   Yes and No at 
the same time.  We don't have the luxury of simple logic.  Of course not, LOL.

If you ask a simple question, like abortion.  If you got a simple answer,
what 
would you expect?  It would be a let-down when you get an ordinary answer to
a 
question that only has ordinary answers.  What do you expect -- the answer 
exists and it is something.  The statement of an answer, looks pathetic when 
it is ordinary.  A manifest answer is a let-down compared to an imprecise 
eager imagination.  (I have learned to be more verbal.  God said Mom thought 
my spirituality was "visciously inferior".  I just combined "eager 
imagination".  Before, I combined "Jews are cornered animals who are

viscious.")

KingJamesBible (Matthew 19:24) God says...
19:24 And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through
the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of
God.

19:25 When his disciples heard it, they were exceedingly amazed,
saying, Who then can be saved?  19:26 But Jesus beheld them, and said
unto them, With men this is impossible; but with God all things are
possible.

19:27 Then answered Peter and said unto him, Behold, we have forsaken
all, and followed thee; what shall we have therefore?  19:28 And Jesus
said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That ye which have followed me,
in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his
glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve
tribes of Israel.

19:29 And every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or
sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my
name's sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit
everlasting life.
