So, God is just.  You know what?  Sometimes, I think justice happens to 
countries over the centuries.  One century, a country invades other
countries. 
 The next century, they get invaded.  It could be my imagination.  Why would 
God punish different people from the perpetraitors?

Jesus wept for Jerusalem.  He said the temple would be destroyed.

Perhaps, if a country is very oppressed, that's its punishment.

You might predict the United States to have civil unrest and a revolution. 
If 
we already suffered in a different way, maybe not.

The NSA spying... and everything you say being public... this generation does 
not have the freedom to hang-out with their friends and not share everything 
with Mom.

Perhaps, assymentric math applies in justice.  An apple is worth so many 
oranges.

KingJamesBible (2 Chronicles 5:7) God says...
5:7 And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD
unto his place, to the oracle of the house, into the most holy place,
even under the wings of the cherubims: 5:8 For the cherubims spread
forth their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubims covered
the ark and the staves thereof above.

5:9 And they drew out the staves of the ark, that the ends of the
staves were seen from the ark before the oracle; but they were not
seen without. And there it is unto this day.

5:10 There was nothing in the ark save the two tables which Moses put
therein at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with the children of
Israel, when they came out of Egypt.

5:11 And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy
place: (for all the priests that were present were sanctified, and did
not then wait by course: 5:12 Also the Levites which were the singers,

brethren, being arrayed in white linen, having cymbals and psalteries

I think this is nice:  I suspect justice exists, but I have no idea what 
balance exists.  If justice exists, but nobody can tell what balance exists, 
you can relax.  It is alarming if you suddenly think you can predict
tragedies 
and punishments, but nobody knows balances.

I wuv You God.  I have no interest in learning secrets.  I think it's good to 
believe in justice.  It sure is easy to think you are owed, when that is not 
the case.  I think it is very common to misjudge.

Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel?  1:7
And he said unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the
seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power.

1:8 But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon
you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all
Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.

1:9 And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was
taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight.

1:10 And while they looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went up,
behold, two men stood by them in white apparel; 1:11 Which also said,
Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same
Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like
manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.

1:12 Then returned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet,
which is from Jerusalem a sabbath day's journey.

KingJamesBible (Exodus 23:18) God says...
23:18 Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened
bread; neither shall the fat of my sacrifice remain until the morning.

23:19 The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring into
the house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his
mother's milk.

23:20 Behold, I send an Angel before thee, to keep thee in the way,
and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared.

23:21 Beware of him, and obey his voice, provoke him not; for he will
not pardon your transgressions: for my name is in him.

23:22 But if thou shalt indeed obey his voice, and do all that I
speak; then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies, and an adversary
unto thine adversaries.

23:23 For mine Angel shall go before thee, and bring thee in unto the
Amorites, and the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites,
the Hivites, and the Jebusites: and I will cut them off.
