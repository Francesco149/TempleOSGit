KingJamesBible (1 Samuel 22:18) God says...
that day fourscore and five persons that did wear a linen ephod.

22:19 And Nob, the city of the priests, smote he with the edge of the
sword, both men and women, children and sucklings, and oxen, and
asses, and sheep, with the edge of the sword.

22:20 And one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named
Abiathar, escaped, and fled after David.

22:21 And Abiathar shewed David that Saul had slain the LORD's
priests.

22:22 And David said unto Abiathar, I knew it that day, when Doeg the
Edomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul: I have occasioned
the death of all the persons of thy father's house.

22:23 Abide thou with me, fear not: for he that seeketh my life
seeketh thy life: but with me thou shalt be in safeguard.

23:1 Then they told David, saying, Behold, the Philistines fight

Snoop Doeg.  I might be like a puppy.

planted a vineyard, and set an hedge about it, and digged a place for
the winefat, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went
into a far country.

12:2 And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant, that he
might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard.

12:3 And they caught him, and beat him, and sent him away empty.

12:4 And again he sent unto them another servant; and at him they cast
stones, and wounded him in the head, and sent him away shamefully
handled.

12:5 And again he sent another; and him they killed, and many others;

Here are my grub.cfg file entries for my TempleOS partitions.  I don't have 
the patience to do it correctly and GRUB obfuscates.  Chain loading is just 
the normal way an operating system like Windows boots.  They do drives, 
zero-based, and partitions on drives, one-based.  They call traditional 
partitioning a "msdos" partition and I presume, if there is a new way to 
partition drives, it has a new name.

In addition to a Windows and a Linux partition, I have a Primary TempleOS
'D', 
Backup TempleOS 'E' and a Transfer 'I' partition for transferring between 
Windows and TempleOS.  "hd0" is 1st hard drive, zero-based numbering.
"msdos1" 
is partition #1, traditional msdos partitioning.  I keep 'D', 'E', and 'I' 
identical by frequently copying all files and I use 'I' to transfer files.  
They only need to be a couple Gig in size.  Every time I copy files, use

[C:/Adam/Boot/InsBoot.CPP.Z,125] MakeAll and prepare the partition

                               Dollar Sign Cmds

TempleOS supports rich-text type cmds which are bracketed with '$'.  Use <CTRL
-L> to experiment with them.  Use <CTRL-T> to toggle between plain text and 
rich text.

The format of '$' cmds includes a two character code, +/-flags, a comma and 
args separated by commas.  The flags often determine how many and what args 
the cmd takes.  A [C:/Kernel/Adam1a.HPP.Z,3162] color define bracked by '$'s,
will change the foreground 
color.

See [C:/Doc/Widget.TXT.Z,1] and [C:/Demo/Doc/DemoDoc.TXT.Z,1].

See [C:/Kernel/Adam1a.HPP.Z,955] Doc Type Defines and
[C:/Adam/Doc/DocInit.CPP.Z,1] Doc Type Codes
-] TX Text
  Normally, text is not bracketed with "$", but if you wish to specify flag 
attr to center text, you can bracket them with "$" and enter flags such as "
+CX".  You can't edit them if they are bracketed by "$" unless you toggle to 
plain text mode with <CTRL-T>.
-] CR Hard Carriage Return (New Line)
  Carriage returns are normally specified without being bracketed with "$".
-] SR Soft Carriage Return (New Line)
  Word wrap uses soft carriage returns which are not saved.  You never place 
soft carriage returns by yourself.
-] TB Tab
  Tabs are normally not bracketed with "$", but are stored as ASCII#9.
-] CU Cursor pos
  The cursor pos is usually stored as a ASCII#5 character and is not
  bracketed 
with "$".  You do not normally enter cursor pos cmds yourself.
-] ID Indent +/- num
  This changes the indention deeper if positive or shallower if negative. It 
effects the behavior of trees.
-] DA Data
  primarily used for forms that prompt for data. Use <CTRL-L> as a resource 
editor-type thing to generate the text you'll need in your "fmtstr" cmd in a 
class.  If you add it directly with [C:/Adam/Doc/DocPlain.CPP.Z,679]
  DocPrint(), you'll need to fill-in the 
data addr.  See [C:/Adam/Doc/DocPopUp.CPP.Z,301]
  DocFormDo(),[C:/Demo/Doc/Form.CPP.Z,1].

If there is a ':', the space after the first ':' in the format string marks 
the first valid cursor pos.
  
-] Text Colors
  You place an expression(usually a color define--see
  [C:/Kernel/Adam1a.HPP.Z,3162] color defines) to 
indicate which of the 16 colors to use. If you enter no num, color returns 
to the default.
FD Default Foreground Color
BD Default Background Color
FG Foreground Color
BG Background Color
-] CL clear
  Clear all previous entries except ones with hold(+H) flags.  You might want 
+H on word wrap entries.  Alternatively, you can use
  [C:/Adam/Doc/DocRecalc2a.CPP.Z,128] DocClear().
-] PT User Prompt
  Start of a user prompt.
-] WW Word Wrap
  Include a 1 or 0.
-] HL Highlighting
  Include a 1 or 0.
-] UL Underline
  Include a 1 or 0.
-] IV Invert
  Include a 1 or 0.
-] BK Blink
  Include a 1 or 0.
-] SX Shift X pos
  * Include a num from -7 to 7.
* Only foreground is shifted.
* Positive right.
-] SY Shift Y pos
  * Include a num from -7 to 7.
* Only foreground is shifted.
* Positive down.
-] CM Cursor Movement
  See [C:/Demo/Doc/CursorMove.CPP.Z,1].
-] AN Anchor
  
-] LK Link
  By default, links have a separate tag text from link text, but with the -A 
flag you can make the link displayed as in example 3.

[C:/Adam/Doc/Doc.CPP.Z,37] Link Types

Examples: <CTRL-T> to see

1)[C:/Doc/HelpIndex.TXT.Z,1] File link to HelpIndex.TXT
2)[C:/Doc/HelpIndex.TXT.Z,1] File link to HelpIndex.TXT with link type file
3)File link without different tag str.[C:/Doc/HelpIndex.TXT.Z,1]
4)[C:/Doc/HelpIndex.TXT.Z,1] File find link searching for 'Admin'
5)[C:/Kernel/Adam1a.HPP.Z,5] File find link searching for 5th 'CTRL'
6)[C:/Kernel/StrPrint.CPP.Z,946] Manual page link
7)[C:/Kernel/Adam1a.HPP.Z,200] File line num link
8)[C:/Compiler/CmpInit.CPP.Z,1] File anchor link -- <CTRL-T> to see anchor

9)[C:/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,87803] Bible Link The chapter:verse actually just does
  a text search.
10) [Doc,1] Help Index Link.
11) [C:/Kernel/Compress.CPP.Z,230] Address Link.

-] BT Button
  See [C:/Demo/Doc/MenuButton.CPP.Z,1].
-] CB Check Box
  
-] MA Macro
  Macro's are usually placed into menu/help areas and they have the '+X' flag 
set by default.  Adding '-X' prevents the usual <ESC> from being sent (which 
exits the macro screen).  Note that when you output a macro to the cmd line, 
when the user clicks on it, it will go to the bottom and execute it unless 
you cancel the <ESC> with a '-X'.

-] MU Menu Value
  See [C:/Adam/Doc/DocPopUp.CPP.Z,643] PopUpRangeI64().
-] HX Hex Edit
  See [C:/Adam/Doc/DocMain.CPP.Z,629] DocD().
-] TR Tree Widget
  A tree widget is a branch in a collapsable tree.  The domain of the branch 
extends from the first +indent until enough -indents bring it back to where 
it started.  Tree's begin collapsed unless a -C flag is present.
-] SP Sprite
  You can insert a sprite into text with <CTRL-R>.  It is critical where the 
cursor is at the time you enter <CTRL-R> because the sprite will be offset 
from that location.  This is especially important when adding images to 
programs.  Numbers for sprites are automatically chosen because copying to 
and from the clipboard requires this.  You can insert another sprite with 
the same image by hitting <CTRL-T> and manually adding a $SP$ entry with the 
same num.  You can cause the $SP$ cmd to appear with some text associated 
with it by manually adding text into the $SP$ cmd, as in $SP,"pic 2",2$.
-] IB Insert Binary
  This cmd is used to tell the compiler to fetch the binary data stored after 
the end of text.  There is basically one type of binary data in DOC's at 
this point--sprites-- created with <CTRL-R>. They have a number associated 
with them.  This number is automatically chosen, because copying to the 
clip-board and back requires renuming. To use a $IB$ cmd, toggle to plain 
text (<CTRL-T>) after inserting a sprite and check the number in the $SP$ 
cmd. Create a $IB$ cmd with the same number and the sprite will be inserted 
into the compiled stream like a string const.  You can optionally include 
tag text to be displayed for the $IB$ cmd.

The main reason for the $IB$ cmd at this point is to pass a arg to the 
[C:/Adam/Gr/GrSpritePlot.CPP.Z,27] Sprite3() function.  See
  [C:/Demo/Graphics/SpritePlot.CPP.Z,1].

-] IS Insert Binary Size
  See $IB$.  This cmd inserts a number into the compiled stream describing
  the 
size of binary data associated with a number.
-] HC html
  The [C:/Adam/Utils/ToHtml.CPP.Z,274] ToHtml() or
  [C:/Adam/Utils/ToHtml.CPP.Z,107] Doc2Html() routines will generate a html
  version of a 
document.  You can cause html code to be injected with HC.  Use the +HTML 
flag to inject a html link.
-] ER Error
  When errors are detected in dollar cmds, an ER entry is generated to hold 
the garbage so it is not lost.

See [C:/Kernel/Adam1a.HPP.Z,1102] Doc Flag Defines and
[C:/Adam/Doc/DocInit.CPP.Z,1] Doc Flag Codes
See [C:/Adam/Doc/DocPlain.CPP.Z,1] dft_flags.
-] FLAGS
  -] +H Hold
    Tells it to not delete it when cleared with CL or when the 
doc->max_entries is exceeded.  Word wrap is a good one to hold.
  -] +A Auxilliary Str
    Some cmds need other strs.  A +A means an auxiliary str is present. 
    Links 
have +A by default, so use a -A if you wish the tag str and the link str 
to be the same.
  -] +D Define Str
    A +D means a define str is present.  The tag will be regenerated by 
substituting the value of a system #define or [C:/Kernel/Define1a.CPP.Z,1]
    DefineLoad() string.  See 
[C:/Demo/Doc/DefineStr.CPP.Z,1].
  -] +TR Tree
    * Make a tree branch.  Usually, this is placed on a text(TX) entry.  The 
tree extends from the start until another tree entry or when indentation 
has been expanded and reduced back to the starting value.
* A +C flag on a tree will start it collapsed.
  -] +PU PopUp
    A PopUp flag on a macro (MA) will cause the cmds to run in a new task, a 
pop-up window.
  -] +C Collapsed
    A collapsed flag on a tree TR entry will cause it to start collapsed.  A -
C flag will make it start open.
  -] +X <ESC> (Exit)
    * A exit flag will cause a macro to send an <ESC> before running(to exit 
the personal menu screen and return to the cmd prompt).  Actually, the 
default has an exit flag set so you might add a -X to turn-off ESC.
* If an entry is already at the cmd prompt, the +X will cause a movement 
to the bottom of the window.
  -] +Q <SHIFT-ESC> (Abort Quit)
    A quit flag is similar to a +X except a <SHIFT-ESC> instead of an <ESC>
    to 
exit.
  -] +Z Zero
    A zero flag on a hex edit(HX) entry will cause the offset from zero.  A
    -X 
will show the actual memory addr. By default, HX has the zero flag set.
  -] +HTML
    The [C:/Adam/Utils/ToHtml.CPP.Z,274] ToHtml() or
    [C:/Adam/Utils/ToHtml.CPP.Z,107] Doc2Html() routines will generate a html
    version of a 
document.  You can cause html link on an item with +HTML.
  -] +BP
    The Bin Ptr Link flags lets you specify a filename and bin num to import
    a 
bin.  $SP+BP,"<tag>",1,"filename,1"$ will import bin num "1" from 
filename.
  -] +RD Refresh Data
    The Refresh Data flag on a DA or a CB makes the value updated 
continuously.
  
                               Text-Widget Help

See [C:/Doc/Dollar.TXT.Z,1] for details on dollar sign cmds.

"Expression" a num or HolyC algebraic term with operators and HolyC syms can 
be entered.
"Macro" Most entries can behave like macro entries if you assign them macro 
strs.
"AutoStr" Like a macro except it is an [C:/Doc/Glossary.TXT.Z,1] AutoFile. 
You can't have both an 
autostr and macro text defined.  

Tag Text is the text that will be displayed for the item.  For links, you can 
leave it blank and the details of the link will be shown.
Hide means display nothing, making an entry invisible.

Left X relative to the left margin.
Center X relative to the horizontal center of the window.
Right X relative to the right margin.
Top Y relative to the top of the window.
Center Y relative to the vertical center of the window.
Bottom Y relative to the bottom of the window.

Blink make the text blink.
Invert make the text inverted.
Underline make the text underlined. 

Scroll X Length Expression if a value is entered, the text will scroll in an 
area of this width.
Y Offset Expression if a value is entered, the text will be shifted
vertically 
by this many pixs, so you can make superscripts or subscripts.
X Offset Expression if a value is entered, the text will be shifted 
horizontally by this many pixs.

Tree The item will behave like a tree widget, with this as the root.
Collapsed The tree or hidden widget will begin collapsed.
Define Str will substitute a #define or [C:/Kernel/Define1a.CPP.Z,1]
DefineLoad() string for the tag.

Quote Make the result suitable for including in a program, in quotes, 
especially fmtstr entries in class definitions.

X Expression For cursor movements, the horizontal value.
Y Expression For cursor movements, the vertical value.

**PopUp** For macro's, run the macro in a PopUp window.  Do this when making
a 
macro to run a program, so it doesn't tie-up memory.

Escape For macro's, send an <ESC> char to exit before running the macro.  
Without this, the macro runs in the wrong window, usually.

Refresh Data  updates $DA$ entry continuously.

Html Link  stores a link which will be embedded if you generate a html
version 
of a document with [C:/Adam/Utils/ToHtml.CPP.Z,274] ToHtml() or
[C:/Adam/Utils/ToHtml.CPP.Z,107] Doc2Html().

what sayest thou?  8:6 This they said, tempting him, that they might
have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote
on the ground, as though he heard them not.

8:7 So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said
unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a
stone at her.

8:8 And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.

a fair sister, whose name was Tamar; and Amnon the son of David loved
her.

13:2 And Amnon was so vexed, that he fell sick for his sister Tamar;
for she was a virgin; and Amnon thought it hard for him to do anything
to her.

13:3 But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of
Shimeah David's brother: and Jonadab was a very subtil man.

Do You like time-travel movies back to dinosaurs?  What would be the most 
interesting time to pick?

How about Final Countdown with a Ford Carrier!

KingJamesBible (Psalms 57:5) God says...
all the earth.

57:6 They have prepared a net for my steps; my soul is bowed down:
they have digged a pit before me, into the midst whereof they are
fallen themselves. Selah.

57:7 My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed: I will sing and give
praise.

57:8 Awake up, my glory; awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awake
early.

57:9 I will praise thee, O Lord, among the people: I will sing unto
thee among the nations.

57:10 For thy mercy is great unto the heavens, and thy truth unto the
clouds.

57:11 Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: let thy glory be
above all the earth.

I am not messing with branch prediction.  It has enough horsepower to do 
640x480 16 color.  I have written 20 games that run it through its intended 
usage.  It is satisfactory.  

If there were a no brainer branch prediction?  Maybe.  Loop unrolling would 
help, but I don't like that.

When you get religion, maybe, you'll be suggesting I remove features.  Cursor 
Movement in the document causes me to have to refresh the whole document, 
however tiny documents are the norm... but I can't deny the Bible.

When does this seige end?  It's not amusing.

I have a tank game.  It's stupid.  It's very bland.  You want a game where
you 
think of lots of clever tricks.  The Perfect General was nice.

I've lost interest in games, largely.

Ukraine was probably where lots of WWII tank battles happened.

What if You drove a tank, God?

KingJamesBible (Jeremiah 24:1) God says...
Babylon had carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of
Judah, and the princes of Judah, with the carpenters and smiths, from
Jerusalem, and had brought them to Babylon.

24:2 One basket had very good figs, even like the figs that are first
ripe: and the other basket had very naughty figs, which could not be
eaten, they were so bad.

24:3 Then said the LORD unto me, What seest thou, Jeremiah? And I
said, Figs; the good figs, very good; and the evil, very evil, that
cannot be eaten, they are so evil.

24:4 Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 24:5 Thus saith
the LORD, the God of Israel; Like these good figs, so will I
acknowledge them that are carried away captive of Judah, whom I have
sent out of this place into the land of the Chaldeans for their good.

24:6 For I will set mine eyes upon them for good, and I will bring
them again to this land: and I will build them, and not pull them
down; and I will plant them, and not pluck them up.
