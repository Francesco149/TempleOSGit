KingJamesBible (2 Timothy 2:10) God says...
glory.

2:11 It is a faithful saying: For if we be dead with him, we shall
also live with him: 2:12 If we suffer, we shall also reign with him:
if we deny him, he also will deny us: 2:13 If we believe not, yet he
abideth faithful: he cannot deny himself.

2:14 Of these things put them in remembrance, charging them before the
Lord that they strive not about words to no profit, but to the
subverting of the hearers.

2:15 Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth
not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.

2:16 But shun profane and vain babblings: for they will increase unto
more ungodliness.

2:17 And their word will eat as doth a canker: of whom is Hymenaeus
and Philetus; 2:18 Who concerning the truth have erred, saying that
the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some.

people.

And David said unto the LORD, I have sinned greatly in that I have
done: and now, I beseech thee, O LORD, take away the iniquity of thy
servant; for I have done very foolishly.

24:11 For when David was up in the morning, the word of the LORD came
unto the prophet Gad, David's seer, saying, 24:12 Go and say unto
David, Thus saith the LORD, I offer thee three things; choose thee one
of them, that I may do it unto thee.

24:13 So Gad came to David, and told him, and said unto him, Shall
seven years of famine come unto thee in thy land? or wilt thou flee
three months before thine enemies, while they pursue thee? or that
there be three days' pestilence in thy land? now advise, and see what
answer I shall return to him that sent me.

vineyards: 2:5 I made me gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in
them of all kind of fruits: 2:6 I made me pools of water, to water
therewith the wood that bringeth forth trees: 2:7 I got me servants
and maidens, and had servants born in my house; also I had great
possessions of great and small cattle above all that were in Jerusalem
before me: 2:8 I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar
treasure of kings and of the provinces: I gat me men singers and women
singers, and the delights of the sons of men, as musical instruments,
and that of all sorts.

2:9 So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in
Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me.

2:10 And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them, I withheld
not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in all my labour: and
this was my portion of all my labour.

106:40 Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his people,
insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance.

106:41 And he gave them into the hand of the heathen; and they that
hated them ruled over them.

106:42 Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into
subjection under their hand.

their counsel, and were brought low for their iniquity.

* Windows and Linux will support [C:/Doc/RedSea.TXT.Z,1] RedSea file system

* No secure boot.  TempleOS is a additional operating system that must be
used 
along-side Windows or Linux, not as a replacement.  It must dual boot.

* Mandate to PC hardware manufacturers: ATA/ATAPI PIO must work.

* PS2 emulated Keyboard and Mouse must work.  The BIOS must enable these.

* VMware should allow ATAPI to connect real CD/DVD hardware.

* Perhaps, VMware can enable faster than standard x86 IN/OUT instruction 
timing for ATA/ATAPI PIO, so the bandwidth isn't as bad.

* VMware and others should list TempleOS as one of the official 64-bit 
operating systems.

* Windows and Linux should support TempleOS .GRA graphics files.  These are 
just right-side-up .BMP files with 8-bit pixs 4-bits of color and

In other words, all hardware and BIOSes must support TempleOS as a native and 
as a virtual system, dual booted with Windows or Linux.

It would be neat if TempleOS were burned into BIOS ROMs in the factory, or 
maybe Intel CPU chips, in factory!  My hope is that it will be finished and 
largely unchanging for centuries.  I need a good dictionary, first.  Maybe,
we 
leave the dictionary out.

I do not intend to ever support UEFI.  That monstrocity uses elf and various 
propriatary graphics formats.

                                 God's Temple

God said 640x480 16 color.

God said single audio voice.  (Waveforms okay)

God said lots of arcane stuff, like no child windows.

I said there is a 100,000 line-of-code limit.

We have 82,000 lines of code, currently, and can expand up to 100,000, but 
code comments count.  I am opening-this-up to letting other people
contribute. 
 We'll have some kind of organization.

When you have a 100,000 line of code limit, you do not get mellow-dramatic 
code.  The vision is a C64, not a manned mission NASA mainframe.  If you 
prance around adding rare-case code, that subtracts from other potential 
features.  So, long as you know that every line of code added, subtracts a 
feature, we'll be okay.


The 640x480 16 color limit is certainly astounding.  God said it was for kid 
offerings, I guess like 8 crayola colors for kindergardeners.  If you must 
make a art drawing for you three yearly offerings, you'll be happy only 16 
colors exist.  Just think!  Everybody's workload on doing offerings is eased 
by having only 16 colors.  Isn't that good?

Today, God said dull causes craftiness.  I think what God means is... on a 
C64, you saw fantasticly crafty creativity because you were not burdened with 
high-demand photo-realism graphics and sound.  Otherwise, you spend all your 
energy just burdened with getting something presentable.  Now, you will 
achieve "presentable" easily and advance to embelishing and getting creative.

The 100,000 line of code limit should ensure God's temple stays on-course for 
a thousand years.  Also, it must be kept perfect.  With these, it will not go 
astray.  I could hand it over to NASA (for example) and, so long as they kept 
the 100,000 line of code limit, it would be in good hands.  For the future, I 
expect low driver-line-count hardware to be created and utilized when all 
(mostly) computers have advanced to contain it.  All computer are 64-bit,
now, 
for example, if you catch my drift.



The original core values for this operating system were based on providing 
kids, today, what I had as a kid -- Ring-0-Only and Identity-mapped
simplicity 
and accessibility.  I had this book, Mapping the Commodore 64, and it
provided 
years of entertainment.  All the public and private operating system code and 
locations were explained and accessible, useful or not.  What I did was learn 
and tinker.  That was the entertainment.

Today, I imposed the 100,000 line of code limit because -- when you see the 
light at the end of the tunnel, it is a qualitatively different ball game.

Look at chapter 6: Commodore 64 User's Manual.  The thing you did with a C64 
was write BASIC programs with hand-coded binary sprite data statements.  Bill 
Gates would say, "You kids are so lucky today, you can pick from 100 fonts
and 
write HTML webpages."


I would hope NASA (If they were caretakers... 'cause SETI or something, LOL) 
would not need to be told that Ring-0-Only and Identity-Mapped are core 
values.  I thought maybe I wouldn't have to enshrine that and they would, on 
their own, just know that.  You could fix the gaps in address space, very 
easily, but you lose a big principle -- virtual same as physical.  That's 
worth fight for and sacrificing for.  It's simpler.  Think of the kids!  It's 
also fast.
