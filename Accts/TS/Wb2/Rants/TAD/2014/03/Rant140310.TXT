I should talk of cheerful thing.  Nobody wants to hear this...

When you are young and get injured, you walk it off.  You exercise it and it 
gets better.


A few years ago, I had back pain.  I tried to walk it off.  It got much
worse! 
 Yikes.

Ten years ago I blew-out my knee.  I have not had surgery.  I was careful to 
protect it over years.  Being dainty it was pretty-much normal.  Week ago, I 
started jogging and it's slightly bad, now.

The one thing you have to know is "Do I exercise it more to work it off or do 
I protect it until it heals."

What a nightmare -- I used to be an atheist.  What if it's my fault?  The
good 
thing is I was not an atheist when Carl Sagan was.  He is not my fault.

If you change your mind in life, the World looks like a train-wreck.  You
just 
have to plow ahead.  It's like shooting people who listened to you in the

IHC7 IHC8 IHC9 IHC10 IHC11  are there more chips like this from other 
manufacturers?  They are mostly similar for SATA, I would guess.  Different 
family device, thing or two different on each one.

You use PCI BIOS to search PCI config space for a device class and subclass.  
The first thing you learn is SATA is 5 different categories, potentially -- 
VMware calls it something, real hardware, something.

Just searching PCI config space with PCI BIOS for a SATA class is hard.

You have like 4 interrupts per bus.  The BIOS sets a certain pin line number.
 
Can other ICH devices share?  Yeah, but you could get away with it.  I'm not 
liking this.  I don't know how to figure-out what interrupt and what's shared.

It seems clear, I have no hope of improving my % of systems it works on.

3:9 Honour the LORD with thy substance, and with the firstfruits of
all thine increase: 3:10 So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and
thy presses shall burst out with new wine.

spoken of for a memorial of her.

14:10 And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went unto the chief
priests, to betray him unto them.

14:11 And when they heard it, they were glad, and promised to give him
money. And he sought how he might conveniently betray him.

14:12 And the first day of unleavened bread, when they killed the
passover, his disciples said unto him, Where wilt thou that we go and
prepare that thou mayest eat the passover?  14:13 And he sendeth forth
two of his disciples, and saith unto them, Go ye into the city, and
there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water: follow him.

14:14 And wheresoever he shall go in, say ye to the goodman of the
house, The Master saith, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat
the passover with my disciples?  14:15 And he will shew you a large
upper room furnished and prepared: there make ready for us.

14:16 And his disciples went forth, and came into the city, and found

Jesus went on a slow bronco drive, huh?

I wonder if the waterboy had an attitude?

So, what, Jesus went around in an underground railroad?

KingJamesBible (Jonah 2:9) God says...
2:9 But I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving; I
will pay that that I have vowed. Salvation is of the LORD.

2:10 And the LORD spake unto the fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon
the dry land.

3:1 And the word of the LORD came unto Jonah the second time, saying,
3:2 Arise, go unto Nineveh, that great city, and preach unto it the
preaching that I bid thee.

3:3 So Jonah arose, and went unto Nineveh, according to the word of
the LORD. Now Nineveh was an exceeding great city of three days'
journey.

3:4 And Jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey, and he
cried, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown.

3:5 So the people of Nineveh believed God, and proclaimed a fast, and
put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them.

KingJamesBible (2 Chronicles 23:8) God says...
23:8 So the Levites and all Judah did according to all things that
Jehoiada the priest had commanded, and took every man his men that
were to come in on the sabbath, with them that were to go out on the
sabbath: for Jehoiada the priest dismissed not the courses.

23:9 Moreover Jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of
hundreds spears, and bucklers, and shields, that had been king
David's, which were in the house of God.

23:10 And he set all the people, every man having his weapon in his
hand, from the right side of the temple to the left side of the
temple, along by the altar and the temple, by the king round about.

23:11 Then they brought out the king's son, and put upon him the
crown, and gave him the testimony, and made him king. And Jehoiada and
his sons anointed him, and said, God save the king.

23:12 Now when Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and
praising the king, she came to the people into the house of the LORD:

He did poetry and tongues.

When I was an engineer, I had no idea that reading skills could advance, just 
like math skills.  I'll bet most engineers scoff at the notion that a senior 
in college literature is as far advanced from high school English as a senior 
in college math is advanced from high school math.

KingJamesBible (Jeremiah 52:24) God says...
Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door: 52:25
He took also out of the city an eunuch, which had the charge of the
men of war; and seven men of them that were near the king's person,
which were found in the city; and the principal scribe of the host,
who mustered the people of the land; and threescore men of the people
of the land, that were found in the midst of the city.

52:26 So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them, and brought
them to the king of Babylon to Riblah.

52:27 And the king of Babylon smote them, and put them to death in
Riblah in the land of Hamath. Thus Judah was carried away captive out
of his own land.

52:28 This is the people whom Nebuchadrezzar carried away captive: in
the seventh year three thousand Jews and three and twenty: 52:29 In
the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar he carried away captive from
Jerusalem eight hundred thirty and two persons: 52:30 In the three and
twentieth year of Nebuchadrezzar Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard
carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred forty and five persons:

The previous pick only matched the video with a knife in hand.  This pick 
confirms that the knife scene was a hit.  This mentions "ha math" which is 
what a college math major thinks of high school.

This response was anemic.  My offerings probably suck.

Now, I think this poem sucks:  The_Road_Not_Taken.  My first time since high 
school and that now sounds like heathen drivel.

What's Your favorite poem, God?

Why don't You write a poem!

I don't think that song is terrible.  I like it.  Neil Degrasse Tyson is 
special partly because he's black.

"Eyesight latter rashly framers"  Duh is about prophecy, now that I think 
about it.  Perhaps, it is about 1783.

KingJamesBible (Genesis 3:1) God says...
3:1 Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which
the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said,
Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?  3:2 And the woman said
unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:
3:3 But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden,
God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest
ye die.

3:4 And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die: 3:5
For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall
be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.

3:6 And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that
it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one
wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto
her husband with her; and he did eat.

3:7 And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they
were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves
