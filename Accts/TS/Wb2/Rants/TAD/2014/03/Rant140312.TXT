RISC is easy.  I made mine use bigger instructions with a lot of work. 
Didn't 
matter much since CPU was putting them back into RISC and the CPU was 
reordering and optimizing.

Having 16 registers and flat memory is easier than real mode.

I started with a stack machine.  I allocated RAX,RBX,RCX,RDX for any use on 
each operation.  The top of the stack was RAX for passing from one operation 
to the next.

I looked for the most common offsets on the stack and allocated RSI,RDI, and 
others to register variables.  R13 and R12 cannot be used for certain 
addressing modes so I only use those as local nonpointer register variables.
I 
go deeper on the stack with R8,R9.

I do not pass arguments to functions in registers.

64-bit compilers are easier since 16 registers.  It's similar to 4 color 
problem with 16 colors, LOL.

KingJamesBible (Daniel 9:16) God says...
9:16 O LORD, according to all thy righteousness, I beseech thee, let
thine anger and thy fury be turned away from thy city Jerusalem, thy
holy mountain: because for our sins, and for the iniquities of our
fathers, Jerusalem and thy people are become a reproach to all that
are about us.

9:17 Now therefore, O our God, hear the prayer of thy servant, and his
supplications, and cause thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary that is
desolate, for the Lord's sake.

9:18 O my God, incline thine ear, and hear; open thine eyes, and
behold our desolations, and the city which is called by thy name: for
we do not present our supplications before thee for our
righteousnesses, but for thy great mercies.

9:19 O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord, hearken and do; defer not,
for thine own sake, O my God: for thy city and thy people are called
by thy name.

My compiler does both JIT and AOT.  It does 64-bit [C:/Doc/HolyC.TXT.Z,1]
HolyC and kinda nasty asm 
[C:/Compiler/OpCodes.TXT.Z,1].  No MMX SSE.  Real-mode asm is really bad, but
you 
only need 64-bit and I saved a lot of complexity with no segmentation and 
using 32-bit MODR instead of 16-bit MODR.  I did an unassembler.  I made my 
own BIN file format. The JIT interacts with the tasks' symbol tables.


Everything I said is true, basically.  Quit fighting me, you retard niggers 
and get onboard with God cause this train is not stopping.

                                   Demands

When God is manifest to the World and He claims this operating system, 
publically, here's what I want:

* VMware to again support PC Speaker and provide emulation if no PC Speaker
is 
present.

* Windows and Linux will support [C:/Doc/RedSea.TXT.Z,1] RedSea file system
so I can get rid of 2,000 
lines of redundant, blemished code -- FAT32 and ISO9660.  God's temple must
be 
perfect.  I view redundant code that performs the same function as imperfect.
 
More than one filesystem type is bad, not good!

[C:/Kernel/Dsk/FileSysRedSea.CPP.Z,1]
[C:/Kernel/Dsk/FileSysFAT.CPP.Z,1]	:1004
[C:/Kernel/Dsk/FileSysISO1.CPP.Z,1]	:306
[C:/Adam/Boot/DskCDDVD.CPP.Z,1]	:536

* No secure boot.  TempleOS is a additional operating system that must be
used 
along-side Windows or Linux, not as a replacement.  It must dual boot.

* Mandate to PC hardware manufacturers: ATA/ATAPI PIO must work.

* PS2 emulated Keyboard and Mouse must work.  The BIOS must enable these.

* VMware should allow ATAPI to connect real CD/DVD hardware.

* Perhaps, VMware can enable faster than standard x86 IN/OUT instruction 
timing for ATA/ATAPI PIO, so the bandwidth isn't as bad.

* VMware and others should list TempleOS as one of the official 64-bit 
operating systems.

* Windows and Linux should support TempleOS .GRA graphics files.  These are 
just right-side-up .BMP files with 8-bit pixs 4-bits of color and 
transparency, with no palette.  Compression is an LZW compression. 
[C:/Adam/Gr/GrDC.CPP.Z,284] DCSave(), 
[C:/Adam/Gr/GrDC.CPP.Z,354] GRAWrite(), [C:/Adam/Gr/GrDC.CPP.Z,323] DCLoad(),
and [C:/Adam/Gr/GrDC.CPP.Z,365] GRARead().  [C:/Kernel/Compress.CPP.Z,1]




In other words, all hardware and BIOSes must support TempleOS as a native and 
as a virtual system, dual booted with Windows or Linux.

It would be neat if TempleOS were burned into BIOS ROMs in the factory, or 
maybe Intel CPU chips, in factory!  My hope is that it will be finished and 
largely unchanging for centuries.  I need a good dictionary, first.  Maybe,
we 
leave the dictionary out.

I do not intend to ever support UEFI.  That monstrocity uses elf and various 
propriatary graphics formats.

                                 God's Temple

God said 640x480 16 color.

God said single audio voice.  (Waveforms okay)

God said lots of arcane stuff, like no child windows.

I said there is a 100,000 line-of-code limit.

We have 82,000 lines of code, currently, and can expand up to 100,000, but 
code comments count.  I am opening-this-up to letting other people
contribute. 
 We'll have some kind of organization.

When you have a 100,000 line of code limit, you do not get mellow-dramatic 
code.  The vision is a C64, not a manned mission NASA mainframe.  If you 
prance around adding rare-case code, that subtracts from other potential 
features.  So, long as you know that every line of code added, subtracts a 
feature, we'll be okay.


The 640x480 16 color limit is certainly astounding.  God said it was for kid 
offerings, I guess like 8 crayola colors for kindergardeners.  If you must 
make a art drawing for you three yearly offerings, you'll be happy only 16 
colors exist.  Just think!  Everybody's workload on doing offerings is eased 
by having only 16 colors.  Isn't that good?

Today, God said dull causes craftiness.  I think what God means is... on a 
C64, you saw fantasticly crafty creativity because you were not burdened with 
high-demand photo-realism graphics and sound.  Otherwise, you spend all your 
energy just burdened with getting something presentable.  Now, you will 
achieve "presentable" easily and advance to embelishing and getting creative.

The 100,000 line of code limit should ensure God's temple stays on-course for 
a thousand years.  Also, it must be kept perfect.  With these, it will not go 
astray.  I could hand it over to NASA (for example) and, so long as they kept 
the 100,000 line of code limit, it would be in good hands.  For the future, I 
expect low driver-line-count hardware to be created and utilized when all 
(mostly) computers have advanced to contain it.  All computer are 64-bit,
now, 
for example, if you catch my drift.



The original core values for this operating system were based on providing 
kids, today, what I had as a kid -- Ring-0-Only and Identity-mapped
simplicity 
and accessibility.  I had this book, Mapping the Commodore 64, and it
provided 
years of entertainment.  All the public and private operating system code and 
locations were explained and accessible, useful or not.  What I did was learn 
and tinker.  That was the entertainment.

Today, I imposed the 100,000 line of code limit because -- when you see the 
light at the end of the tunnel, it is a qualitatively different ball game.

Look at chapter 6: Commodore 64 User's Manual.  The thing you did with a C64 
was write BASIC programs with hand-coded binary sprite data statements.  Bill 
Gates would say, "You kids are so lucky today, you can pick from 100 fonts
and 
write HTML webpages."


I would hope NASA (If they were caretakers... 'cause SETI or something, LOL) 
would not need to be told that Ring-0-Only and Identity-Mapped are core 
values.  I thought maybe I wouldn't have to enshrine that and they would, on 
their own, just know that.  You could fix the gaps in address space, very 
easily, but you lose a big principle -- virtual same as physical.  That's 
worth fight for and sacrificing for.  It's simpler.  Think of the kids!  It's 
also fast.

----03/12/14 00:33:32----

* There is a concept in BASIC -- one size integer.  Remember this principle
as 
an intersting thing to remember.

* To me, not using getter/setters is less abstract and requires one-less 
look-up operation to understand.  My compiler does not do in-line, also.

* I saw Linux #ifdef mess for different architectures.  I said, "I will do
the 
opposite.   One architecture."  I saw 7 levels of functions when I chased
down 
IDE port instructions.  That seemed bad, so I wanted minimal levels, minimal 
abstraction.

I want no virtual file system -- just real file system once we get rid of 
FAT32 and ISO9660 so we just have [C:/Doc/RedSea.TXT.Z,1] RedSea.  One file
system is perfect -- 
multiple filesystems is crappy.  Minimal lines of code, remember.

----03/12/14 00:40:55----

I will cripple this operating system by making it read and write whole files.
 
This idea is a core value.  We get text compression.  We get simple code for 
beginers.  We get high performace because all blocks are contiguous.

If this is not acceptable, just use Linux or Windows.  This is acceptible.

Look, people, if it is not different in a useful way, it's just an inferior 
Linux.  You actually get a pleasant system when you do whole files.

This operating system has been proven to work on 20 applications and hymns.  
These applications cover the whole range of anticipated usage model.  The 
vision was a souped-up Commodore 64.  It is proven to work as planned.

----03/12/14 01:01:03----

I wrote my own Computer Graphics Library.  It might be a little weak.  I
don't 
want to hear any of you people with SAT below 1440 making any comments.  If 
you have higher SAT, maybe you'd enjoy improving God's temple.

I did a line draw with slope and fixed point math.  Wouldn't that be 
interesting if the DIV for slope was no longer expensive and my way was now 
best.

None of this is for GPUs.  Those will never be used.  I think they violate
the 
transparency feature where the whole point is you can tinker with the kernel 
and gain understanding.

I promise you my original vision was based on remembering what I did with
this 
book and the years of entertainment it provided.

* Mapping the Commodore 64

The book is about all the public AND private code in the C64 ROM and the 
hardware.

Did you know the main usage of a C64 was hobby programming.  The people who 
bought the first computer were nerds who made little basic programs with 
sprite data hand calculated on graphic paper like they show in the C64 users 
guide.

Just white people, I guess.

Y'all can do hymns though... and participate if software happens.
