KingJamesBible (Ezra 10:8) God says...
all his substance should be forfeited, and himself separated from the
congregation of those that had been carried away.

10:9 Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered themselves
together unto Jerusalem within three days. It was the ninth month, on
the twentieth day of the month; and all the people sat in the street
of the house of God, trembling because of this matter, and for the
great rain.

10:10 And Ezra the priest stood up, and said unto them, Ye have
transgressed, and have taken strange wives, to increase the trespass
of Israel.

10:11 Now therefore make confession unto the LORD God of your fathers,
and do his pleasure: and separate yourselves from the people of the
land, and from the strange wives.

10:12 Then all the congregation answered and said with a loud voice,
As thou hast said, so must we do.

Oh, that applies both ways, huh.

Do you know what my pet peeve is?  SciFi never has a planet with larger 
gravity.  If you went to the surface of Jupiter, you'd be flat on your ass, 
unable to lift a finger.  If a planet has ten times the gravity, one stair is 
like ten stairs and you have ten Gs sucking you down.  Matter-of-fact, your 
face would be distorted.... maybe.

Give some sci-fi ideas, God!!  Please!!

6:11 And there came an angel of the LORD, and sat under an oak which
was in Ophrah, that pertained unto Joash the Abiezrite: and his son
Gideon threshed wheat by the winepress, to hide it from the
Midianites.

6:12 And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him, and said unto him,
The LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour.

6:13 And Gideon said unto him, Oh my Lord, if the LORD be with us, why
then is all this befallen us? and where be all his miracles which our
fathers told us of, saying, Did not the LORD bring us up from Egypt?
but now the LORD hath forsaken us, and delivered us into the hands of
the Midianites.

6:14 And the LORD looked upon him, and said, Go in this thy might, and
thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the Midianites: have not I
sent thee?  6:15 And he said unto him, Oh my Lord, wherewith shall I
save Israel?  behold, my family is poor in Manasseh, and I am the
least in my father's house.

let them bring forth their witnesses, that they may be justified: or
let them hear, and say, It is truth.

chosen: that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I am he:
before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me.

I give 10% tithe.  My logic is give 10% no matter how much or how little you 
have.  If you haved a lot, make jobs.  I even made-up for my atheist 
non-giving phase.  It's kinda embarassing admitting that when I was an 
atheist, I was not, in fact, a good person, LOL -- you kinda think you are,

course.

I'm really mean and take pleasure in charities that not always include the 
poor.  I give to NPR, sometimes.  I have given to a preacher, Chuck Swindol.  
He's good.  I don't give to the Catholic Church.  It's like a Jew who really 
eagerly tells you how much he loves pork.  It's funny because I don't like 
pork, especially, myself, oddly, but bacon.  I'll eat ham.  The texture is
not 
my favorite.

In theory, I'd like to give to zoos, since they cause praise of God, but 
haven't yet.  (I like to annoy liberals since the animals are captive -- ever 
since Dad worked for nuclear power, I have been anti-liberal.)   Telescopes 
cause praise.  They are really really neat.  I would enjoy working on 
telescopes.

You know what?  We're not going to get any more fabulous new pictures from 
telescopes.  I'm pretty sure, that's how it works -- we gotten just about all 
we will get by way of fabulous pictures.

God has not begged for zoos.  I thought He was delighted at all the kids 
seeing His magnificient animals.  God doesn't like my drumming and God
doesn't 
care about zoos.  He once commented on animal cruelty, I think.  He tells me 
not to be cruel to the dog.

Growing-up I was Catholic and was told immigration was a sad situation and 
some people in the church broke the law.

Recently, God said no more immigration.  I had an ephiphany -- there is 
nothing evil with no-immigration.  God very carefully gives birthrights.  He 
decides how smart, how handsome, how talented, how rich, what country, what 
race, what species.

The biggest grievance in the world exists because the evil injustice of the 
Catholic church overspreading unfairly their genes.  Of course people are 
pissed-off.  God is slightly pissed about some having too few babies, but all 
can be resolved peacefully with a simple no-immigration policy.

If God thinks no-immigration is okay, who can possibly raise arguement?

On the Arab Jew conflict, God said "Oil funny, hopefully".  God loved Jacob 
and hated Esau.  Esau gave-up his birthright.  God's favorite saint is Santa.
 
God wants to be the hero.  His big job is handing-out birthrights.  That's
the 
main thing He does.
