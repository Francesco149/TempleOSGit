execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man.

5:28 Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that
are in the graves shall hear his voice, 5:29 And shall come forth;
they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that
have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.

5:30 I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my
judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of
the Father which hath sent me.

5:31 If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.

5:32 There is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the
witness which he witnesseth of me is true.

KingJamesBible (2 Samuel 16:23) God says...
16:23 And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counselled in those
days, was as if a man had enquired at the oracle of God: so was all
the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom.

17:1 Moreover Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Let me now choose out
twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David this
night: 17:2 And I will come upon him while he is weary and weak
handed, and will make him afraid: and all the people that are with him
shall flee; and I will smite the king only: 17:3 And I will bring back
all the people unto thee: the man whom thou seekest is as if all
returned: so all the people shall be in peace.

17:4 And the saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of
Israel.

17:5 Then said Absalom, Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let us
hear likewise what he saith.

KingJamesBible (Numbers 4:18) God says...
Levites: 4:19 But thus do unto them, that they may live, and not die,
when they approach unto the most holy things: Aaron and his sons shall
go in, and appoint them every one to his service and to his burden:
4:20 But they shall not go in to see when the holy things are covered,
lest they die.

4:21 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 4:22 Take also the sum of
the sons of Gershon, throughout the houses of their fathers, by their
families; 4:23 From thirty years old and upward until fifty years old
shalt thou number them; all that enter in to perform the service, to
do the work in the tabernacle of the congregation.

4:24 This is the service of the families of the Gershonites, to serve,
and for burdens: 4:25 And they shall bear the curtains of the
tabernacle, and the tabernacle of the congregation, his covering, and
the covering of the badgers' skins that is above upon it, and the
hanging for the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, 4:26 And

I wrote a HD Audio driver.  It worked on two machines out of 5.  It did not 
work in VMware on the machine it should have.  Routing wires to the speaker 
(in software) would require artificial intelligence.  Mine would go out all 
speakers and headphones as best it could.  I did not use interrupts, just big 
DMA buffers.

I am not doing PCI devices.  They don't belong.  I imposed a 100,000 line of 
code limit.  I do not want more than one driver for each kind of device.  I 
will issue divine commands to hardware companies to produce low-driver line 
count devices.  CIA has been fucking it up.  If HD Audio is universal in ten 
years and not as fucked-up as it is now, God said single audio voice

worse than a 154% design.

things that get better at small scale.  I do not use a linker.  I do not use
a 
make.  I just #include all files into one BIN.  I try to make awesome short

20:18 And the children of Israel arose, and went up to the house of
God, and asked counsel of God, and said, Which of us shall go up first
to the battle against the children of Benjamin? And the LORD said,

[C:/Demo/Games/EagleDive.CPP.Z,1]
[C:/Demo/Games/CastleFrankenstein.CPP.Z,1]


I made an 8-core flight simulator.  Nobody else can do real-time multicore.  
Ask them.  I do master/slave instead of SMP.

I did an eagle diving for fish.  How's that for creativity?


My X-Caliber game has space walks.

I'll bet this has been considered, but a neat benchmark would be a compiler's 
time to compile itself.  If you add lots of code for optimizations, they 
require more time to compile and are only good if they improve it 
sufficiently.

Everybody must do hymns.

KingJamesBible (Isaiah 51:4) God says...
for a light of the people.

51:5 My righteousness is near; my salvation is gone forth, and mine
arms shall judge the people; the isles shall wait upon me, and on mine
arm shall they trust.

51:6 Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look upon the earth
beneath: for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth
shall wax old like a garment, and they that dwell therein shall die in
like manner: but my salvation shall be for ever, and my righteousness
shall not be abolished.

51:7 Hearken unto me, ye that know righteousness, the people in whose
heart is my law; fear ye not the reproach of men, neither be ye afraid
of their revilings.

51:8 For the moth shall eat them up like a garment, and the worm shall
eat them like wool: but my righteousness shall be for ever, and my
salvation from generation to generation.

The CIA and Microsoft have clusterfucked all but the simplest things.  Why do 
you think China doesn't have an operating system?

You must first kill the CIA, then you can have success.  That's where God 
comes in.

Silly person -- they will clusterfuck it far faster than you can keep up.

I do ATA/ATAPI PIO because that's the only sane option unless you want 
something half-ass that runs an a machine or two.

Get God to kill the CIA, then profit.

now that there shall fall unto the earth nothing of the word of the
LORD, which the LORD spake concerning the house of Ahab: for the LORD
hath done that which he spake by his servant Elijah.

and all his great men, and his kinsfolks, and his priests, until he
left him none remaining.

Ahaziah king of Judah, and said, Who are ye? And they answered, We are

KingJamesBible (Acts 24:27) God says...
24:27 But after two years Porcius Festus came into Felix' room: and
Felix, willing to shew the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound.

25:1 Now when Festus was come into the province, after three days he
ascended from Caesarea to Jerusalem.

25:2 Then the high priest and the chief of the Jews informed him
against Paul, and besought him, 25:3 And desired favour against him,
that he would send for him to Jerusalem, laying wait in the way to
kill him.

25:4 But Festus answered, that Paul should be kept at Caesarea, and
that he himself would depart shortly thither.

25:5 Let them therefore, said he, which among you are able, go down
with me, and accuse this man, if there be any wickedness in him.

25:6 And when he had tarried among them more than ten days, he went
down unto Caesarea; and the next day sitting on the judgment seat
commanded Paul to be brought.

I saw a phone demo.

God said 640x480 16 color.

I don't use GPU.  I have a 100,000 line of code limit I imposed.  Multiple
GPU 
drivers could never fit in the 100,000 limit.

I don't care about mobile.

I like my interface.

So, I started with a C64 up-off-the-bottom command-line.  I wanted Unix 
command history.  I decided to press CTRL-M to get to a list of my command 
history on the screen.  I changed it into a fixed-document with text widgets 
for macros.  I added pictures to my macros and I had icons.  It's very nice.

31:21 Blessed be the LORD: for he hath shewed me his marvellous
kindness in a strong city.

31:22 For I said in my haste, I am cut off from before thine eyes:
nevertheless thou heardest the voice of my supplications when I cried
unto thee.

faithful, and plentifully rewardeth the proud doer.

32:1 Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is
covered.

32:2 Blessed is the man unto whom the LORD imputeth not iniquity, and
in whose spirit there is no guile.
