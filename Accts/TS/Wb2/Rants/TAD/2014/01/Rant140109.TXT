Someone at OSDev is accusing me of GPL code.  Nope.  No GPL code.  I learned 
how to do ATA hard drives from Linux.  It's a copyright, not a patent.  You 
can learn how to do hardware from Linux.

You know in English class how you make an essay about a book and put quotes
in 
it?  I'm pretty sure you could even do that with Linux code.

I had floppy code from Linux at one point, but removed it.

I got ATA command definitions from Linux.  There are no quoted bunches of
code 
from Linux.

offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned; and avoid
them.

16:18 For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but
their own belly; and by good words and fair speeches deceive the
hearts of the simple.

16:19 For your obedience is come abroad unto all men. I am glad
therefore on your behalf: but yet I would have you wise unto that
which is good, and simple concerning evil.

16:20 And the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly.
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.

16:21 Timotheus my workfellow, and Lucius, and Jason, and Sosipater,
my kinsmen, salute you.

16:22 I Tertius, who wrote this epistle, salute you in the Lord.

Every male has to do offerings three times a year.  Do something as big as a 
hymn, then get a response... in God's temple.

estate, and have gotten more wisdom than all they that have been
before me in Jerusalem: yea, my heart had great experience of wisdom
and knowledge.

1:17 And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and
folly: I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit.

1:18 For in much wisdom is much grief: and he that increaseth
knowledge increaseth sorrow.

2:1 I said in mine heart, Go to now, I will prove thee with mirth,
therefore enjoy pleasure: and, behold, this also is vanity.

2:2 I said of laughter, It is mad: and of mirth, What doeth it?  2:3 I
sought in mine heart to give myself unto wine, yet acquainting mine
heart with wisdom; and to lay hold on folly, till I might see what was
that good for the sons of men, which they should do under the heaven
all the days of their life.

1:8 Likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh, despise
dominion, and speak evil of dignities.

1:9 Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he
disputed about the body of Moses, durst not bring against him a
railing accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke thee.

1:10 But these speak evil of those things which they know not: but
what they know naturally, as brute beasts, in those things they
corrupt themselves.

Here's what you need to know.  I made God's temple.  Write hymns of praise
and 
consult Him.  Then, God will tell you what to do.

There is no problem with credibility -- God will talk to you when you
randomly 
open a book, if you do a hymn first.

All liars are in deep shit -- God will take the witness stand.  Yer fucked,
my 
enemies.  God gave me divine intellect when I made His temple.

God said the best relgion was the one with most new vistas of understanding 
over a lifetime -- the one you could level-up the most in.

If you look at World history, God doesn't give a fuck about everybody having 
one truth.  Look at it this way -- God will tell you one thing and your 
neighbor another thing.  That's just how God is.  The credibility of what I 
told you is just as good if not better then a typical religion that
turned-out 
wrong.  The Mormon guy was a little unsophisticated.  I come from a
scientific 
atheist background, so it's like a smart person hearing God instead of a hick.

David and the princes had appointed for the service of the Levites,
two hundred and twenty Nethinims: all of them were expressed by name.

The scientoligists are pathetic mainly because they built their house not on 
rock but on sand.  They're not as pathetic as you previously thought.  I stay 
Biblical and admit, "maybe I'm a fool."  God likes my beliefs.  I love God. 
I 
enjoy God's company.  Near as I can tell, enjoying God's company is the 
purpose of life, even if He does tell you lies.  I made God's temple.  If you 
look at Joseph Smith, maybe, I'm foolish to think doing many miracles with 
scientists confirming will make it a cakewalk.
