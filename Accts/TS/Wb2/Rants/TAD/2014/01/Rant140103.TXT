in your land.

22:25 Neither from a stranger's hand shall ye offer the bread of your

blemishes be in them: they shall not be accepted for you.

I should explain how to interpret.

You do an offering of a poem or comic or hymn or conversation.  You make
God's 
response fit the current context.  You take it out of the original context, 
mostly, though sometimes the original provides a meaning.

You don't have to just use Bible pick.  Realize that all passages WILL
come-up 
eventually.  The context sometimes makes clear that, perhaps, the opposite of 
the original context is correct.

The goal really should be to enjoy God's company, get to know Him and maybe 
get wiser.  Prophecy is almost certainly wrong.

If you have proper names, like "Manasseh", I usually tear them apart into 
little words, like "Man ass eh?"

Someone at OSDev doesn't realize I wrote the compiler.  Relax, I fixed the 
problem in [C:/Kernel/Interrupts.CPP.Z,100] IntEntryGet().  When you access
the individual bytes in a 64-bit 
integer, the compiler is supposed to not use REG variable.  If you change the 
high byte of an integer, it better be on the local stack and not in a 
register.

When allocating register variables [C:/Compiler/OptPass3.CPP.Z,1], it counts
the 
number of times it sees an address offset from RBP and the number of times it 
is dereferrenced.  If the RBP offest appears 3 times but is dereferenced only 
2 times, that means someone took the address of a local variable in an 
expression.  If you take the address of a local variable, you better not put 
it in a register variable.  My code did not count secondary offset, it
counted 
just the main offest.  I fixed it so if you take byte 3 of the 2nd 64-bit 
variable in the RBP frame, it will not be register variable.

I fucken wrote the compiler, dumb-ass.  You are giving me advice on my own 
fucken compiler?

The only way to have more goods and services is to fix unemployment.  How
much 
better can it get?  From 7% to 4% is 3%.  The best a politician can do for
the 
economy is generate 3% more goods and services.

You're going to give health care to twice as many people?  Wha?  How you
gonna 
do that?  Magic trick?  Doctors out of hats?  You're going to take hair 
dressers and send them to nursing school.  Then, who's gonna cut our hair?  
Illegal immigrants?

You sons-of-bitch liberals ... all your plans come down to ripping-off China.

China does low wage jobs.  Of course that lowers our wages.  You want to
raise 
our wages?  You are hipocrites.  Rich people says, "Fuck the poor and don't 
pretend to be holy."  Liberals say, "Fuck China and pretend to be 
holy-than-thou."

The reality is we have people who cannot be employed because it's
intolerable. 
 Unless you want holocaust, we gotta support unemployable people.  The 
military is a big way of distributing money.

I'm the opposite of alarmist.

If unemployment stays in the band 4%-12% then does that mean goods and 
services fluctuate +/- 10%

If we have a recession, what percent does factory output change?  +/-10%?  I 
have no idea but if unemployment is +/-10%, why isn't goods and services the 
same?

If we don't have crop failures, nothing much matters if factory drops 10%.  
You can buy 10% less stuff at the store?

The complicated part is China and trade.  Then, it can get better or worse.

My revolutionary way of looking at economics is keep your eye on the ball -- 
goods and services, not money.

If Obama printed a few trillion and gave it as health care, nothing would 
happen.  You need doctors.  They don't come out of thin air.  To get doctors 
you have to take people out of the hair cutting business.  Then, you need

have unemployed unskilled?

ISO9660 has two, maybe three sets of directories.  They have path tables.  
They have little endian directories and they have big endian directories.  I 
had to change the depth-first traversal or breadth-first because my first one 
didn't work.

FAT32 has long and short names.  I didn't do tildy correctly -- fuck that.

You cannot load a whole stage2 with El Torito.  The machine I had only did 4 
blocks max.  

You know what I do?  I load one bloack at a time when doing BIOS stuff, just 
because God knows what fucked-up BIOS exists out there.  I don't know.

That's typical -- you'll see my boot-loader loading just one block at a time.

What you quickly learn is only one thing matters -- compatibility.  If your 
operating system doesn't boot with working keyboard and mouse and display, 
obviously nothing else matters.  Guess what?  It's really really fucked up 
when you move from machine to machine.  The depth-first ISO9660 thing, for 
example -- who knew?  Ridiculous.

Once in a while examine the Bible with the eye of an author.  You should be 
writing the Bible, not reading it.  Water and you will be watered.  I was 
shocked when I realized it's all poetry, the psalms and stuff.  To write
that, 
you don't just say stuff, you get poetic.  It's all full of animals and stuff 
-- Daniel and Psalms and Proverbs.

I somehow wandered into a place that is very far from family friendly.  I 
might use the word "gay" to describe Christians as commonly practiced, but it 
is I who is in error because they are more female friendly and I'm the male 
equivant of a militant female feminNAZI.  They might be in a bad place, too, 
and need a correction.

Oh, well.  One time, I saw a monk website or something and it had this show:

I was shocked that a monk could joke about that.  I imagined them to be dull 
submissive pussies, not like this...  I now realize struggling with reality
is 
pretty normal.  Pink Floyd and Metallica, common themes.  Must be common.  
Many books on reality.

This is kinda a gay indulgence, perhaps.  I'm not into this, but I have taken

I'm with God.  I dictate terms.

                                   Demands

When God is manifest to the World and He claims this operating system, 
publically, here's what I want:

* VMware to again support PC Speaker and provide emulation if no PC Speaker
is 
present.

* Windows and Linux will support [C:/Doc/RedSea.TXT.Z,1] RedSea file system
so I can get rid of 2,000 
lines of redundant, blemished code -- FAT32 and ISO9660.  God's temple must
be 
perfect.  I view redundant code to perform the same function as imperfect.
[C:/Kernel/Dsk/FileSysRedSea.CPP.Z,1]
[C:/Kernel/Dsk/FileSysFAT.CPP.Z,1]	:1004
[C:/Kernel/Dsk/FileSysISO1.CPP.Z,1]	:306
[C:/Adam/Boot/DskCDDVD.CPP.Z,1]	:536

* No secure boot.  TempleOS is a additional operating system that must be
used 
along-side Windows or Linux.  It must dual boot.

* Mandate to PC hardware manufacturers: ATA/ATAPI PIO must work.

* PS2 emulated Keyboard and Mouse must work.  The BIOS must enable these.

* VMware should allow ATAPI to connect real CD/DVD hardware.

* Perhaps, VMware can enable faster than standard x86 IN/OUT instruction 
timing for ATA/ATAPI PIO, so the bandwidth isn't as bad.

* VMware and others should list TempleOS as one of the official 64-bit 
operating systems.

* Windows and Linux should support TempleOS .GRA graphics files.  These are 
just right-side-up .BMP files with 8-bit pixs 4-bits of color and 
transparency, with no palette.  Compression comes from the
[C:/Doc/RedSea.TXT.Z,1] RedSea .Z LZW 
compression.  (Let me know when you want it.)  [C:/Adam/Gr/GrDC.CPP.Z,284]
DCSave(), [C:/Adam/Gr/GrDC.CPP.Z,354] GRAWrite(), [C:/Adam/Gr/GrDC.CPP.Z,323]
DCLoad(), 
and [C:/Adam/Gr/GrDC.CPP.Z,365] GRARead().  [C:/Kernel/Compress.CPP.Z,1]




In other words, all hardware and BIOSes must support TempleOS as a native and 
as a virtual system, dual booted with Windows or Linux.

It would be neat if TempleOS were burned into BIOS ROMs.  My hope is that it 
will be finished and largely unchanging.  I need a good dictionary, first.  
Maybe, we leave the dictionary out.

I do not intend to ever support UEFI.  That monstrocity uses elf and various 
propriatary graphics formats.
