Know what we would do?  We would make Intel chips with MMU-less cores, no 
paging, just ring0, no SSE MXX and have a shitload.  We would still want to 
run with Windows or Linux.  Would it save significant silicon or boost 
performance?  Our goal would be doing graphics on CPU, just for transparency.

thee of me?  18:35 Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and
the chief priests have delivered thee unto me: what hast thou done?
18:36 Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom
were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be
delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence.

18:37 Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus
answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and
for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto
the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice.

18:38 Pilate saith unto him, What is truth? And when he had said this,
he went out again unto the Jews, and saith unto them, I find in him no
fault at all.

18:39 But ye have a custom, that I should release unto you one at the
passover: will ye therefore that I release unto you the King of the
Jews?  18:40 Then cried they all again, saying, Not this man, but
Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.

of Israel, as well to the women as men, to every one a cake of bread,
and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon of wine. So all the people
departed every one to his house.

6:20 Then David returned to bless his household. And Michal the
daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, How glorious was
the king of Israel to day, who uncovered himself to day in the eyes of
the handmaids of his servants, as one of the vain fellows shamelessly
uncovereth himself!  6:21 And David said unto Michal, It was before
the LORD, which chose me before thy father, and before all his house,
to appoint me ruler over the people of the LORD, over Israel:
therefore will I play before the LORD.

6:22 And I will yet be more vile than thus, and will be base in mine

Big Data

Our goal is a souped up 64-bit commodore 64, a joy to program.  We want the 
CPU cores to do graphics in a transparent way indstead of on a GPU.  I have 
done many games with real-time multicore graphics without GPU.  God said He 
wants 640x480 16 color, single audio voice.  We have a 100,000 line of code 
limit.  I currently have 81,488.  I am telling you, not asking you how it 
should be.

The C64 offered users the chance to program in BASIC.  Bill Gates says, HTML.
 
That is the difference in visoon, but mine is [C:/Doc/HolyC.TXT.Z,1] HolyC.

Get educated on God's temple at this point, then you will not be ignorant.

Basically, we have no GPU and do many CPU cores for 640x480 16 color.

Not-invented-here is the spirit of programming.  By not hiding GPU code, we 
make heaven for programmers.  Just imagine a 32-bit pair of A-2-D and D-2-A 
buffered with DMA.  A pair of joysticks.  ATA/ATAPIO PIO for harddisk CDROM 
but high speed IN/OUT port mode of hardware.

God said Dickens times were rough.  I think highs and lows balance.  
Luke 6:20-26.  When I say highs and lows balance, it's not a very satisfying 
profound phenomina.  Basically, if you have hope for something not obtained, 
it counts as mood-lifting.  Basically, every day you go throught slight 
changes in mood and I suggest they balance.  Jesus said if you laugh you will 
cry;  if you cry you will laugh.  Some people say it is not wise to laugh.  
It's a big distraction, but my point is... how do I explain this... just
being 
alive, you will have some mood, mostly blah... you will have highs and you 
will have lows.  Even if you were in prison, your mood would not be low the

78:65 Then the LORD awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man
that shouteth by reason of wine.

78:66 And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a
perpetual reproach.

78:67 Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the
tribe of Ephraim:

78:68 But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.

78:69 And he built his sanctuary like high palaces, like the earth
which he hath established for ever.

78:70 He chose David also his servant, and took him from the
sheepfolds:

78:71 From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed
Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.

4:24 This is the service of the families of the Gershonites, to serve,
and for burdens: 4:25 And they shall bear the curtains of the
tabernacle, and the tabernacle of the congregation, his covering, and
the covering of the badgers' skins that is above upon it, and the
hanging for the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, 4:26 And
the hangings of the court, and the hanging for the door of the gate of
the court, which is by the tabernacle and by the altar round about,
and their cords, and all the instruments of their service, and all
that is made for them: so shall they serve.

4:27 At the appointment of Aaron and his sons shall be all the service
of the sons of the Gershonites, in all their burdens, and in all their
service: and ye shall appoint unto them in charge all their burdens.

4:28 This is the service of the families of the sons of Gershon in the
