6:24 We have heard the fame thereof: our hands wax feeble: anguish
hath taken hold of us, and pain, as of a woman in travail.

6:25 Go not forth into the field, nor walk by the way; for the sword
of the enemy and fear is on every side.

6:26 O daughter of my people, gird thee with sackcloth, and wallow
thyself in ashes: make thee mourning, as for an only son, most bitter
lamentation: for the spoiler shall suddenly come upon us.

6:27 I have set thee for a tower and a fortress among my people, that
thou mayest know and try their way.

6:28 They are all grievous revolters, walking with slanders: they are
brass and iron; they are all corrupters.

* Windows and Linux will support [C:/Doc/RedSea.TXT.Z,1] RedSea file system
so I can get rid of 2,000

[C:/Adam/Boot/DskCDDVD.CPP.Z,1]	:536

* No secure boot.  TempleOS is a additional operating system that must be
used 
along-side Windows or Linux, not as a replacement.  It must dual boot.

* Mandate to PC hardware manufacturers: ATA/ATAPI PIO must work.

* PS2 emulated Keyboard and Mouse must work.  The BIOS must enable these.

* VMware should allow ATAPI to connect real CD/DVD hardware.

* Perhaps, VMware can enable faster than standard x86 IN/OUT instruction 
timing for ATA/ATAPI PIO, so the bandwidth isn't as bad.

* VMware and others should list TempleOS as one of the official 64-bit 
operating systems.

* Windows and Linux should support TempleOS .GRA graphics files.  These are 
just right-side-up .BMP files with 8-bit pixs 4-bits of color and 
transparency, with no palette.  Compression comes from the
[C:/Doc/RedSea.TXT.Z,1] RedSea .Z LZW 
compression.  (Let me know when you want it.)  [C:/Adam/Gr/GrDC.CPP.Z,284]

DCLoad(), 
and [C:/Adam/Gr/GrDC.CPP.Z,365] GRARead().  [C:/Kernel/Compress.CPP.Z,1]




In other words, all hardware and BIOSes must support TempleOS as a native and 
as a virtual system, dual booted with Windows or Linux.

It would be neat if TempleOS were burned into BIOS ROMs in the factory, or 
maybe Intel CPU chips, in factory!  My hope is that it will be finished and 
largely unchanging for centuries.  I need a good dictionary, first.  Maybe,
we

Silly people -- in 1990 at age 20, my first assignment when working on 
Ticketmaster's operating system was CheckDsk/Fix. VMAP

In 2004, OSNews and the NSA were tormenting me over FAT32.  You know how they 
like to grieve me with torment on any weakness.  In 2004, I said, "I need to 
make a filesystem that does not violate the FAT patent."  I could do like the 
Commodore 64 and put block chain pointers at the end of each block.  (The 
niggers mocking me are so retarded they cannot imagine even one alternative
to 
FATs, how much you want to bet?)  

So, the C64 had pointers in the last two bytes of each 256 byte disk block 
that pointed to the next in the chain.  God that's awful!! LOL.  Fuck.  How
do 
I not use FAT tables?  Ticketmaster had an allocation bitmap, instead of FAT.
 
They used a hash table for disk directroru entries.  It's high performance.  
Contiguous files are higher performance.  

Ticketamster did ordered-IO to rearrange disk block head movements for best 
results, like elevator.

Anyway, so I made a filessystem without FAT.  And, I got used to it, and
liked 
it.  I copied cluster concept from FAT, but now I have just one sector per 
cluster--that is true to my mission.  

Ticketamster had account numbers.  The numbers were block number on a drive 
with no filesystem.  They did file IO as block offsets with block-read and 
block-write, for highest performance.

I got used to whole-file access and not growing files.  You can do 
compression!!  How cool is that?!!

I simplified all my code by loading and saving whole files.

My highest goal is low line count and simple code.

I don't care if it can crash, under abuse.

I don't care if it won't do everything -- use Windows.

We already have one Linux.  You fucken retards -- if you turn it into Linux, 
you have a wortheless thing.

                                   TempleOS

In 1990 at age 20, I was hired to work on Ticketmaster's VAX operating system 
in VAX assembly language while going to school.  I was basically, an intern, 
but we weren't called that.  I worked there 1990-1996.  Here are my 
ASU Transcripts.

In about 1993, I got a 486 and was eager to try 32-bit mode, so I wrote a DOS 
program in TASM that changed to protected mode and never returned to DOS.  
Ticketmaster's OS was "VAXTMOS", so I called mine "Terry's Protected Mode OS, 
TPMOS".  I had 0xB8000 text mode working, and echoed keyboard to screen.  I 
had simple multitasking and barely a MALLOC.  I set it asside.

In 2003, I resurrected TPMOS and installed FreeDOS to launch it.  I used 
Visual Studio to edit my files when doing lots of editing, then booted 
FreeDOS, used TASM to compile and test it.  Back in those days, FreeDOS ran
in 
real mode.  Today's FreeDOS is not real mode, it emulates with V8086 mode.  
DOSBox is not real mode either.

I had started a company H.A.R.E., so I renamed TPMOS to HOPPY.

I named it Doors, DAVOS, J, LoseThos, SparrowOS and, finally, TempleOS.

I like food porn.

There are only two vast categories you can praise God for -- animals/plants 
and food.

I like being naughty.  What if Zoos are the best things -- not reserves.  
Where else does God take delight in watching people enjoy His creations?

meat offering, and his drink offering.

29:32 And on the seventh day seven bullocks, two rams, and fourteen
lambs of the first year without blemish: 29:33 And their meat offering
and their drink offerings for the bullocks, for the rams, and for the
lambs, shall be according to their number, after the manner: 29:34 And
one goat for a sin offering; beside the continual burnt offering, his
meat offering, and his drink offering.

29:35 On the eighth day ye shall have a solemn assembly: ye shall do
no servile work therein: 29:36 But ye shall offer a burnt offering, a
sacrifice made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD: one bullock,
one ram, seven lambs of the first year without blemish: 29:37 Their
meat offering and their drink offerings for the bullock, for the ram,
and for the lambs, shall be according to their number, after the
manner: 29:38 And one goat for a sin offering; beside the continual

I learned as much if not more at Ticketmaster as I did in school.  I didn't
do 
any exceptional work.  I was there six years.  I am mostly ashamed, looking 
back, but that's probably natural.  Oh, I was not a garbage man.  I was a 
junior engineer who mostly did learning -- did a lot of fruitless research.

I'll bet many people with master's degrees, when they are ten years after 
graduation, look back at their research days and groan.  I didn't do a thesis 
master's.  I did a take-6-extra-hours masters.

I'll bet lots of people groan when they think about their research.

23:33 And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary,
there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand,
and the other on the left.

23:34 Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what
they do. And they parted his raiment, and cast lots.

23:35 And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them
derided him, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he be
Christ, the chosen of God.

23:36 And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering
him vinegar, 23:37 And saying, If thou be the king of the Jews, save
thyself.

23:38 And a superscription also was written over him in letters of
Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.

23:39 And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him,
saying, If thou be Christ, save thyself and us.

My problem was not being given humble garbageman stuff but exaulted stuff
that 
was too hard.

I think they say at Google, the garbagemen have PhD's.  It was certainly 
nothing like that!  It was the opposite... literally.  Lots of 
noncredentialed, but smart people.  At age 20, I wrote a VAX Checkdisk/fix, 
known as VMap.

I'm spoiled.  I don't deal with any code I did not write myself.

When it comes to physical activity, walking is no sweat, lifting is exertion.

My mental activity is all walking and no lifting.  I gain a lot of wisdom, 
though.  I used to be below age level on communication skills... I've made a 
lot of progress.  I'm not talking grammar.

It's one thing to do things.  It's another thing knowing what to do.

Some people run really fast... in the wrong direction.  When in comes to 
operating systems, it would be easy zombie-walk making Linux again.  Most 
people look at what I have and look at Linux and would dive-in, moving me
from 
the point I am toward the point that is Linux.  They take one look and say, 
"It's obvious you have a whole bunch to do... do so and so."  I'm actually 
done.

If you told me we could do 1600x1200 24-bit, but it would take 200,000 lines 
of code and would involve different code for different hardware (assume we 
could cover everybody, which we couldn't)...

This would depart from the spirit.  My vision is a modern souped-up 64-Bit 
x86_64 Commodore 64.  It don't really want non-transparent code.

I am very firm in my vision.
