1:1 Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a
declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us,
1:2 Even as they delivered them unto us, which from the beginning were
eyewitnesses, and ministers of the word; 1:3 It seemed good to me
also, having had perfect understanding of all things from the very
first, to write unto thee in order, most excellent Theophilus, 1:4
That thou mightest know the certainty of those things, wherein thou
hast been instructed.

1:5 THERE was in the days of Herod, the king of Judaea, a certain
priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abia: and his wife was of the
daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth.

1:6 And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the
commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.

1:7 And they had no child, because that Elisabeth was barren, and they
both were now well stricken in years.

My GRA File format is okay.  I'm slightly disappointed because it is 4 bit

almost as good as 2x4-bit.

I used to have checksums on files in RedSea file system.  I got rid of it.  
Stupid.

I have never had a bad block, but I've had drives fail.

I have never had a bad RAM.

I put one FAT table (allocation of one bit per block, actually).

I don't do bad block substitution in my file system.

I keep it simple, on purpose.

It happens to be the case that I know a lot about CRC polynomials.  I took a 
spread spectrum course where you use shift registers as PRNG for encoding.  
The goal is spreading in frequency, not security so much.

I'm tired of delusional communication.

Suppose you have z^-1 as a delay.

you make a polinomial for the shift register.



z^2+2*z+1

If you can factor the algebra, it is not prime.

If it is not prime, a shift register with those taps will repeat itself in a 
suboptimal way.

You want a prime polynomial for most things.  If N is the number of delays.  
There are 2^N states the shift register can have.  If it is a prime 
polynimial, it will cycle through (2^N)-1 states.  It cannot cycle through
the 
zero state because that just repeats zero over and over.


There are two interchangable ways to work with shift registers.  One kinda 
looks serial and the other parallel, more or less, talking abstractly as 
nonsense, not quite.


I am not an expert on how error correction works, but it should be really 
simple shit.  We did autocorrelations for Gold Code polynomials and shit.

Okay, every country modify TempleOS so it is custom just for their country.

The vision is a kid-friendly Commodore 64 usage pattern.  It was not ugly, 
clunky cumbersome professional.  It was for kids.  It was simple.  It was

Mine should be customized with specific code for specific countries.  With
100 
different sets of simple code, all the kids are happy.  No interoperability, 
perhaps.  It's okay, it's not focused on 3rd party software developers, but
on 
1st party software developers, like the C64 was... sorta.  It's for people 
doing offerings to God.  The C64 user's manual told how to make a balloon 
sprite by binary numbers for pixels.  It did!  Look at the C64 user's manual.

Bill Gates will say, "In the awful bad old days kids had to make graphics by 
hand with graph paper and binary numbers in BASIC DATA statements."  "You'd 
much rather be doing hex color codes in HTML!"

Instead of doing arm, I want each architecture to have separate versions with 
simple code.  It's only 100,000 lines of code.  You can spring for that, 
China!  Come-on chump change.

I don't know of it should be for different architectures -- my vision is home

what.

convince 
you.  You either know it's not corrupt or you decide to make bogus ones,
which 
does no harm and shows I trust it and shows you I don't know ahead of time.  
If you did a bogus one and I casually dismissed it, it would boost 
credibility.

If you are reporters, NIST is suspect, if you are tin-foil hat conspiracy 
people.  Once you know God exists, you guys all look pathetic with the huge 
weight of evidence that becomes obvious.  When you know God exists, suddenly 
you see the huge evidence you were a fool to overlook.

I have nobody better to use the NIST from a credibility standpoint.  I can
ask 
you to open your own book.  That is better.  Do an offering by writing a

then open the Bible randomly and place a finger.

* See [C:/Doc/ImportExports.TXT.Z,1] Scoping and Linkages for details on
extern, import, _extern, _import, 
etc.

* See [C:/Doc/Directives.TXT.Z,1].

* Built-in types include I0,I8,I16,I32,I64 for signed 0-8 byte ints and U0,U8,
U16,U32,U64 for unsigned 0-8 byte ints and F64 for 8 byte floats.

	U0	void
	I8	char
	U8	unsigned char
	I16	short
	U16	unsigned short
	I32	int
	U32	unsigned int
	I64	long (64-bit)
	I64	unsigned long (64-bit)
	F64	double
	no F32 float.

* Function with no args, or just default args can be called without 
parentheses. 

* Default args don't have to be on the end.  This code is valid:
  U0 Test(I64 i=4,I64 j,I64 k=5)
{
  Print("%X %X %X\n",i,j,k);
}

Test(,3);

* A char const all alone is sent to [C:/Kernel/Display.CPP.Z,199] PutChars().
 A string with or without args 
is sent to [C:/Kernel/StrPrint.CPP.Z,946] Print().  An empty string literal
signals a variable fmt_str 
follows.

  void Demo(char drv,char *fmt,char *name,int age)
{
  printf("Hello World!\n");
  printf("%s age %d\n",name,age);
  printf(fmt,name,age);
  putchar(drv);
  putchar('*');
}

U0 Demo(U8 drv,U8 *fmt,U8 *name,I64 age)
{
  "Hello World!\n";
  "%s age %d\n",name,age;
  "" fmt,name,age;
  '' drv;
  '*';
}

* When dealing with function addresses, precede the name with "&".

* There is no main() function.  Any code outside of functions gets executed
on 
start-up, in order.

* You can access bytes or words within any int.  i.u8[2] returns bits 24-27
in 
the variable, i.  See [C:/Kernel/Adam1a.HPP.Z,50] I64 declaration.  The real
feature is that a class can 
be accessed as a whole, if you put a type in front of the class declaration.

* Variable arg count functions (...) can access their args with built-in 
variables similar to 'this' in C++.  They are 'I64 argc' and 'I64 argv[]'.  
  
  U0 GrPrint(CDC *dc,I64 x,I64 y,U8 *fmt,...)
  {
    U8 *buf=SPrintJoin(NULL,fmt,argc,argv);
    GrPrint(dc,x,y,buf);
    Free(buf);
  }
  
* Allows "5<i<j+1<20" instead of "5<i && i<j+1 && j+1<20".
  
if (13<=age<20)
  "Teen-ager";

* switch statements always use a jump table.  Don't use them with cases with 
really big, sparse ranges.

* Allows ranges like "case 4...7:" in switch statements. 

* nobound_switch can be used if you know a switch statement will not exceed 
the lowest or highest case values.  It's a little faster because it doesn't 
check.

* sub_switch_start/sub_switch_end allow a new type of nested-switch control 
flow.  (Don't goto, throw exception or return out of sub_switch_start front 
porch area.)

  U0 SubSwitch()
{
  I64 i;
  for (i=0;i<10;i++)
    switch (i) {
      case 0: "Zero ";	break;
      case 2: "Two ";		break;

* noreg or reg can be placed before a function local var name.  You can, 
optionally, specify a reg after the reg keyword.

* interrupt, haserrcode, public, argpop or noargpop are function flags. See 
[C:/Demo/Lectures/PageTableEntries2.CPP.Z,1].

* A nounusedwarn statement will suppress an unused var warning.

* You can have multiple member vars of a class named "pad" or "reserved", and 
it won't issue warnings. 

* Type casting is postfix.  To typecast int or F64, use
[C:/Kernel/Adam1b.HPP.Z,197] ToI64(), [C:/Kernel/Adam1b.HPP.Z,199] ToBool()
or 
[C:/Kernel/Adam1b.HPP.Z,198] ToF64(). (TempleOS follows normal C float<-->int
conversion, but sometimes you 
want to override.  These functions are better than multiplying by "1.0" to 
convert to float.) 

* A single quote can encompass multiple characters.  'ABC' is equal to 0x43424
1.  [C:/Kernel/Display.CPP.Z,199] PutChars() takes multiple characters.

* The "`" operator raises a base to a power.

* There is no question-colon operator.

* TempleOS [C:/Compiler/CmpInit.CPP.Z,1] operator precedence

* You can use [C:/Compiler/ICLCC.CPP.Z,6] OptOn([C:/Kernel/Adam1a.HPP.Z,1469]
OPTf_WARN_PAREN) to find unnecessary parentheses in code.

* You can use [C:/Compiler/ICLCC.CPP.Z,6] OptOn([C:/Kernel/Adam1a.HPP.Z,1470]
OPTf_WARN_DUP_TYPES) to find dup local var type 
statements.

* With the #exe{} feature in your src code, you can place programs that
insert 
text into the stream of code being compiled.  See [C:/Kernel/KEnd.CPP.Z,1]
#exe {} for an example where 
the date/time and compile-time prompting for cfguration data is placed into a 
program.  [C:/Compiler/CmpMain.CPP.Z,1] StreamPrint() places text into a src
program stream following the 
conclusion of the #exe{} blk.

* No #define functions exist (I'm not a fan)

* No typedef, use class.

* No type-checking

* Can't use <> with #include, use "".

* "$" is an escape character.  Two dollar signs signify an ordinary $.  See 
[C:/Doc/Dollar.TXT.Z,1].  In asm or [C:/Doc/HolyC.TXT.Z,1] HolyC code, it
also refers to the instruction's 
addr. 

* union is more like a class, so you don't reference it with a union label 
after you define it.  Some common unions are declared in
[C:/Kernel/Adam1a.HPP.Z,12] Adam1a.HPP for 1,2,4 
and 8 byte objects.  If you place a type in front of a union declaration,
that 
is the type when used by itself.  See [C:/Demo/SubIntAccess.CPP.Z,1]. 

* class member vars can have meta data. fmtstr and fmtdata are two meta data 
types now used.  All compiler structures are saved and you can access the 
compiler's info about classes and vars.  See [C:/Demo/ClassMeta.CPP.Z,1] and  
[C:/Adam/Doc/DocPopUp.CPP.Z,301] DocFormDo().

* There is a keyword lastclass you use as a dft arg.  It is set to the class 
name of the previous arg.  See [C:/Adam/Dbg2a.CPP.Z,134] ClassRep().

* See [C:/Demo/Exceptions.CPP.Z,1].  try{} catch{} and throw are different
from C++. 
throw is a function with a char arg.  The char string passed in throw() can
be 
accessed from within a catch{} using the Fs->except_ch.  Within a catch {} 
blk, set the var Fs->catch_except to TRUE if you want to terminate the search 
for a handler.  Use [C:/Kernel/Except.CPP.Z,46] PutExcept() as a handler, if
you like.

* A function is available similar to sizeof which provides the offset of a 
member of a class.  It's called offset.  You place the class name and member 
inside as in offset(classname.membername).  It has nothing to do with 16-bit 
code.  Both sizeof and offset only accept one level of member vars.  That is, 
you can't do sizeof(classname.membername.submembername).

* There is no continue statement.  Use goto.

* No bit field support, but there are bit access [Bit,1] library routines.

* lock{} can be used to apply asm LOCK prefixes to code for safe multicore 
read-modify-write accesses.  The code bracked with have LOCK asm prefix's 
applied to relevant instructions within.  It's a little shoddy.  See 
[C:/Demo/MultiCore/Lock.CPP.Z,1].

* There is a function called [C:/Kernel/Mem1b.CPP.Z,371] MSize() which gives
the size of an object 
allocated off the heap.  For larger size allocations, the system rounds-up to 
a power of two, so MSize() lets you know the real size and you can take full 
advantage of it.

* You can [C:/Kernel/Mem1b.CPP.Z,370] Free() a NULL ptr.  Useful variants of
[C:/Kernel/Mem1b.CPP.Z,376] MAlloc() can be found [C:/Kernel/Mem1b.CPP.Z,383]
Here.  
Each task has a heap and you can MAlloc and Free off of other task's heaps,
or 
make an independent heap with [C:/Kernel/Mem1c.CPP.Z,42] HeapCtrlBPInit().

* The stk does not grow because virtual mem is not used.  I recommend 
allocating large local vars from the heap.  You can change
[C:/Kernel/Adam1a.HPP.Z,2584] DFT_STK and 
recompile Kernel or request more when doing a [C:/Kernel/Task1a.CPP.Z,225]
Spawn().  You can use 
[C:/Kernel/Task1a.CPP.Z,89] CallStkGrow(), but it's odd.  See
[C:/Demo/StkGrow.CPP.Z,1]. 

* Only one base class is allowed.

* All values are extended to 64-bit when accessed.  Intermediate calculations 
are done with 64-bit values.

  The follow examples should be inserted in a function, so that reg variables 
are used.  (Global vars are never reg.)

I16 i;
I32 j;
j=i=0x12345678; //Resulting i is 0x5678 but j is 0x12345678

I64 i=0x8000000000000000;
Print("%X\n",i>>1);  //Result is 0xC000000000000000 as expected

U64 u=0x8000000000000000;
Print("%X\n",u>>1);  //Result is 0x4000000000000000 as expected

I32 i= 0x80000000;   //const is loaded into a 64-bit reg var.
Print("%X\n",i>>1);  //Result is 0x40000000

I32 i=-0x80000000;
Print("%X\n",i>>1);  //Result is 0xC0000000 as expected


                                 Print Family

[C:/Kernel/StrPrint.CPP.Z,954] MPrint() is like
[C:/Kernel/StrPrint.CPP.Z,932] SPrint() but it returns a
[C:/Kernel/Mem1b.CPP.Z,376] MAllocated str.  It is vary handy 
because you don't have to worry about overflow.

[C:/Kernel/SrvCmd.CPP.Z,491] Auto(U8 *fmt,...) sends text to the current
task's input buffer.
[C:/Kernel/SrvCmd.CPP.Z,472] AutoStr(U8 *fmt,...) sends text of an
[C:/Doc/Glossary.TXT.Z,1] AutoFile to the keyboard stream of the 
current TASK but can also do mouse cmds.

[C:/Kernel/SrvCmd.CPP.Z,451] XTalk(CTask *task,U8 *fmt,...) and text to
another task's input buffer.
[C:/Kernel/SrvCmd.CPP.Z,501] XTalkStr(CTask *task,U8 *fmt,...) sends text of
an [C:/Doc/Glossary.TXT.Z,1] AutoFile to the keyboard 
stream of another TASK but can also do mouse cmds.

[C:/Adam/Doc/DocPlain.CPP.Z,679] DocPrint(CDoc *doc,U8 *fmt,...) sends text
to a document.  You can buffer to a 
Doc and save it, providing the functionality of fprintf.  See 
[C:/Demo/Dsk/FPrintF.CPP.Z,1].

[C:/Kernel/SrvCmd.CPP.Z,404] Adam(U8 *fmt,...) sends text to the adam task to
be compiled and run.
[C:/Kernel/SrvCmd.CPP.Z,425] AdamLog(U8 *fmt,...) and
[C:/Kernel/SrvCmd.CPP.Z,437] AdamErr(U8 *fmt,...) send text to the adam task
to be 
displayed.

[C:/Compiler/CmpMain.CPP.Z,1] StreamPrint(U8 *fmt,...) sends text to the
stream of code being compiled and 
must reside in a #exe{} blk.

[C:/Adam/Gr/GrBitMap.CPP.Z,866] GrPrint(CDC *dc,I64 x,I64 y,U8 *fmt,...) and
[C:/Adam/Gr/GrBitMap.CPP.Z,875] GrVPrint() plots text in graphics 
mode.

[C:/Compiler/CmpMain.CPP.Z,640] ExePrint(U8 *fmt,...) compiles and execute a
string.  Note: It returns the 
result of the last executed expression.

[C:/Adam/AutoFile2a.CPP.Z,28] AFPrint(I64 mS,U8 *fmt)
[C:/Kernel/Display.CPP.Z,199] PutChars()s one at a time with a delay.

[C:/Kernel/Dbg1a.CPP.Z,222] RawPrint(I64 mS,U8 *fmt) sends direct to screen
memory, bypassing window 
manager.

**Note:** Use Print("%s",src) if you need an unmodified string.


The [C:/Kernel/StrPrint.CPP.Z,946] Print() family supports extended format
codes.  See [C:/Kernel/StrPrint.CPP.Z,247] SPrintJoin().
  %[-][0][width][.decimals][flags][hsub_fmt][main_fmt]

flags:
    * 't' is a flag which will truncate to field width.
* ',' is a flag which will add commas every three digits in a %d, %f, %g, 
%e and %n entries.
* '$' is a flag which affects the %Q entry, converting '$' to "\044".
* '/' is a flag which affects the %Q and %q entries, converting '%' to "%%
".
* 'k' is a flag which forces 1000 instead of 1024 on integer with sub_fmts
.
  
sub_fmt:
    For "%n", "%d" or "%u", the sub_fmt causes thousands mode.  "%h?n" will 
pick a var exponent multiples of three unit, while "%h-3n" will display 
milli units or "%h6n" will display mega units.  The 'k' flag is always on 
for "%n".  See [C:/Demo/Print.CPP.Z,1].
  
*  "%n" will print a floating point in engineering notation, exponents being 
multiples of three.  If it has a sub_fmt code, it will display scientific 
units letters.

* "%S" will print a Define entry.

* "%C" will print a ToUpper character.

* "%F" will print a text file.

* "%p" will display ptr.

* "%P" will display link to ptr.

* "%T" and "%D" will display a date or time if you pass a
  [C:/Kernel/Adam1a.HPP.Z,202] CDate.

* "%z" will display a subentry of an enumerated list of text entries.  It 
calls [C:/Kernel/Str1a.CPP.Z,385] LstSub().  Pass subentry first, list second.

* "%Z" will display a Define subentry.  Pass subentry first, lst_define 
second.

* "%Q" will convert "\" to "\\" and quote to backslash quote. (For use in 
creating strs in strs.)

* "%q" will reverse a "%Q".

Fighting the last war is a typical mental roadblock.  It's amazing how 
difficult it is not to be a heard thinking who fights the last war. 
I grew-up 
when computers were invented.  It never occurred to me there were 5 types of 
video games.  I went through life thinking every video game came from
nowhere. 
 My experience was living through the birth where they all came from nowhere 
and defined generes.

As an old person, I have a strange twist in thinking that helps me.  I made 
King Wenceslas.  I made space walks on space game with ship damage so you
only 
turn left.  I made cattle round-up.

Bill Gates?  Think about the road ahead.  We now have photorealistic first 
person shooters.  Guess what?  What's going to happen for a thousand years.  
Well we'll have a hell of a lot of photorealistic first person shooters,
won't 
we!  LOL.

When photography happened, artists stopped doing photorealism.

With any luck, soon, nobody will care much about photorealism in games.

A person who draws a cartoon, in fact, does not try for realism, but better 
than realism in terms of evocative forms.  They entertain with their own 
version of reality.

What's the road ahead for Intel and CPUs?  Think about a thousand years.  I 
have a hard time imagining a need for digital designers.

Oh God help us if Intel keeps a thousand digital designers busy for a
thousand 
years on the same God damn chip.  It will be hypervisor in hypervisor in 
hypervisor.  Bunch of crazy-ass lame instructions.

People will go to any length for 2% performance.

I would rather they sit down and cancel any drastic measure they undertook 
that only got 2% performance improvemnet.

I saw a webcast of God-knows what -- some guy had a tool he was selling that 
pulled-up windows and did shit in some programming language that was
automated 
and he was really proud of it.  For the first time in my life I felt like 
normal person with contempt for nerds.  LOL  I don't give a shit about every 
single fucken language.  You reach a point where it all seems like nerd shit 
you've seen before.  You don't look forward to learning new boring bullshit.

So this guy made even more bullshit to learn in addition to this bullshit 
language he was automating.

God help-us!  We got layer upon layer upon layer of bullshit building-up.

My operating system ... has no glory when it is run in VMware.  It makes a 
difference when my operating system is riding right on the bare metal without 
5 layers below it.  It... just... matters...  There is not 5 layers of 
bullshit below it.  It feels good.  If you poke hardware, it is comforting -- 
you know what is going on.

There are so many layers built-up.  It's all nerd bullshit and nobody cares.  
Why would a kid want to do that stupid-ass nerd bullshit?

When you compund software for 5 languages and 5 platforms... you no longer
get 
the satisfaction for churning-out useful code.  It is fucken trench warfare.

Computing has been turned into trench warfare slugfest... intentionally.  
Write a USB driver.  Fucken ridiculous.  I could write an operating system in 
the time you could write a USB driver.   Bill Gates and Warren Buffet said a 
company was like a castle.  This USB bullshit is his moat. 

In India, the rich keep thing inefficent to make jobs.  FUCK YOU!  Just give 
us money.

Fucken USB is bullshit.

Robots are less shitty than this hell hole of fonts and gay-ass layer on
layer 
of nerd bullshit and queer interior web design.  Design is for faggots.

Microsoft and Intel is like the government printing press of tax code.  They 
churn-out 1,000 pages a day of tax code.  They are not ashamed.  They are 
making shitty-ass jobs for people who can spend all day surfing the Internet 
and robbing their companies because it's all stupid shit.

Here's what you do.  You put a size limit on lines of code.  Otherwise, you 
product just goes through a lifecycle.

Learn not to make needless layers of bullshit automation type shit.  I seek
to 
have developers working with my C64-like ROM without 3rd party libraries.

One company made us use a 3rd party little clock widget or some bullshit.  
Managers, today, "not invented hear" and make us use fancy widget shit.

Guess what?  "Not invented here" is about what makes programmers happy.  Why 
do you like being a tormentor and making people unhappy?  Some people love 
making people miserable.

You are niggers.  I wrote a compiler.

Understand?

[C:/Doc/Boot.TXT.Z,1]

Mine comes on an ISO, like Linux.

You burn a CDROM and boot it.  Computers from 2007-2011 probably work.  
Otherwise you run it in VMware or QEMU.

You need to create a hard drive file for QEMU and install onto it.

I wrote an Installer.  You are niggers, I am a professional.

You run my install script and it installs onto a prepared partition.  You can 
use my partitioner if you select USER under the live CD Boot.

If you use Grub, you chainload.  Grub is obsfucated.  They are not your

If my tank game were awesome and addictive, I guess that would be okay.  I 
have no innovations to be proud of, so there's no glory.  I could provide 
addictive enjoyment.

simple as an example.  Am I crazy?  What sense would it make to take them 
seriously?  It's like asking if we could live without Zynga.  Mine seems

That game is terrible from the standpoint of "work, not fun."  It's really 
slow and wastes a huge amount of time on menial shit.  Imagine you are an 
admiral in the navy and you micromanage every single fucken ship!

Strangely, I never minded doing all the stupid micromanaging.  It was fun.  
that game is fucken criminal as a waste of time.  I'm not saying just takes a 
long time to play, I'm saying the game play is ridiculously wasteful of time!
 
I used to enjoy doing all the tedious micromanaging because I wanted optimal 
play, not automatic.

What I like about that game is it has an elegant combat system.  They managed 
a system with 50/50 odds on everything, but just had different hit points.  
You have no idea how brilliant that is.  I highly respect the elegance of the 
combat system.

I was tempted to port that game, the only game I considered.  It has code for 
one thing, lol.  It's D not C.  I don't know what that is.  It's not that
big, 
but I guess the artificial intelligence in these war games can be huge.  
Obviously, that's the only thing demanding programmer smarts.  I don't feel 
any desire to prove myself.  Knuth and friends could do artificial 
intelligence.  I'm happy just doing simple stuff.  I'll do hard stuff if I 
have to.  I like Knuth.  Earlier I was talking shit because some people don't 
appreciate the talent for making hard shit look easy.  Doing hard shit is

know they must save registers... they do the interrupt line calculations 
shodily so they work on their current computer, then they brag they know 
interrupts.

You did NOT do the interrupt line properly, I'm sure.

I can do system calls faster than everybody else because I never change from 
ring-0.  My overhead is lower.  If it's a long system call, it's not 
important.

I don't market it as high performance.  That's as misguided as programming in 
all-assembly language and calling the rest of the world stupid for using 
compilers.  In other words, I'm not saying mine is high performance because 
it's ring-0-only.

The reason for ring-0-only is simple code.  I'm so confident, I'll let future 
generations do what they like with-in the 100,000 lines of code limit.  If 
they really want ring-3, they could exchange for it.  No, don't do that.

I can change tasks faster because I don't mess with address maps -- it's 
always identity mapped.  I can do 4,000,000 task save+restore operations per 
second per core.

That's nice, but I'm not trumpeting that.  It lets me do my spin-loop trick, 
though.  I spin while Yielding() while waiting for disk.

The funny thing is I have just keyboard, mouse, disk, CDROM and VGA and CPUs 
and PIT and PIC and Internal Speaker.  What's funny is I don't generalize 
about spinning while Yielding -- I have just those devices and my Disk code 
happens to work that way, but I don't have a mechanism for other devices 
because there aren't any other devices.  Actually I spin on locks, so 
nevermind, I do it in general, but I don't do it on keyboard or mouse.  My 
CPUs are put in HALT state -- they are not left spinning, except on disk.

Identity-mapping makes interprocess communication trivial.  There is, 
literally, nothing to it -- you might not know that other operating systems 
have problems!

I'm not selling it on performance, but on simplicity, which is an odd thing.  
The logic is that open source matters to some people because the source code 
is meant to be looked-at.

I pay a big performance penalty on the stack not being growable in size.  You 
have to adapt programming to a fixed size stack.  You can't just do recursive 
algorithms dangerously deep.  I use heap instead of stack which is slower, 
heap-allocated char buffers are nice for not being fixed size, though, as
they 
would be on stack, so you get some side advantages.

I have almost no arrays (except strings).  I avoid them in favor of dynamic 
size lists.  My code is simple and elegant.  On normal no-crash systems, you 
might think no size limits are good.  The problem is on normal 
no-crash-allowed systems you have to prevent running out of memory.  In my 
operating system it is awesome because I have no limits and I don't check for 
running out of memory, so the code is super simple and you almost never have 
limits.

If you are heathen communist atheists, I hardly need to tread lightly.

If you are liberal Catholics, I'm going to gently suggest you do not have an 
accurate view of happiness.  I could talk about many misconceptions but 
basically King Midas works.  If you had money, maybe it stops making you 
happy.

It sounds a little bit tragic if the nation of Cuba gets terrible sorrows
with 
each defector.

I encounter a lot of latins who look at me and think they are just as good if 
not better.  My personality is I am deceptively easy to misunderestimate.

You can bet a whole bunch of the people who mocked Bush underestimated him.

He does one thing and every kid disrepectfully thinks he's smarter than Bush.

There is this common misconception -- a band like Nirvana comes out.  Soon
ten 
bands are playing the same style.  There are people who do not understand why 
they are any less clever than Nirvana.  They think the world is unfair
because 
they can play this style of music better than Nirvana.  They bitch about how 
unfair it is and how record producers are corrupt and Nirvana sold-out. (I 
don't know what that means but they might say it, LOL.)

What do you say to someone who does not see themselves accurately compared to 
others?

I suggest you start with God saying the world is more or less just.  Then, 
work backward.

If someone says the world is not fair for some reason, I guess sometimes the 
world changes and it gets corrected.  Mostly, you have to assume they are not 
understanding what they are talking about.

KingJamesBible: God says...
62:2 And the Gentiles shall see thy righteousness, and all kings thy
glory: and thou shalt be called by a new name, which the mouth of the
LORD shall name.

62:3 Thou shalt also be a crown of glory in the hand of the LORD, and
a royal diadem in the hand of thy God.

62:4 Thou shalt no more be termed Forsaken; neither shall thy land any
more be termed Desolate: but thou shalt be called Hephzibah, and thy
land Beulah: for the LORD delighteth in thee, and thy land shall be
married.

62:5 For as a young man marrieth a virgin, so shall thy sons marry
thee: and as the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride, so shall thy God
rejoice over thee.

62:6 I have set watchmen upon thy walls, O Jerusalem, which shall
never hold their peace day nor night: ye that make mention of the
LORD, keep not silence, 62:7 And give him no rest, till he establish,
and till he make Jerusalem a praise in the earth.
