Running in VMware instead of native, the graphics suffer if you change lots
of 
the screen.  In VMware, it's about 85% of the CPU time just to update the 
screen at 60fps with a test pattern alternating 0x5555555555555555 / 
0xAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.  Natively the test is 15% of CPU time.

That test isn't as important as it seems.

I'm happier without GPU.  I like doing transparent Multicore graphic
rendering 
with all the code simple and in the open.

It performs fine as it is with 640x480.

I'm looking forward to a KnightsLanding 72 core chip.  I'll bet something
gets 
fucked up.

Gates or the CIA is going to shoot an arrow at God.  I'm gonna laugh my ass 
off.

11:15 He that is surety for a stranger shall smart for it: and he that
hateth suretiship is sure.

11:16 A gracious woman retaineth honour: and strong men retain riches.

11:17 The merciful man doeth good to his own soul: but he that is
cruel troubleth his own flesh.

11:18 The wicked worketh a deceitful work: but to him that soweth
righteousness shall be a sure reward.

11:19 As righteousness tendeth to life: so he that pursueth evil
pursueth it to his own death.

11:20 They that are of a froward heart are abomination to the LORD:
but such as are upright in their way are his delight.

11:21 Though hand join in hand, the wicked shall not be unpunished:

ministered, took they away.

good for a writing a boot-loader.

Do you have the slightest clue how complicated segmentation makes the 
assembler and compiler?  I wrote my own assembler and I did not do 
segmentation.

I am not in the business to help you boot your operating system.  My 
boot-loaders are to boot my operating system.  You will never be in
real-mode, 
so you don't need 16-bit segmentation instructions.

Performance of the editor is labored when opened to the Bible.  The document 
command set has a "cursor movement" command which can result in the cursor 
insert point moving up the page and resting on top of the first layer of
text. 
 The document editor is designed to be very fast when serving as the 
command-line window and experiencing StdOut being streamed into the insert 
point.

The way I see it, I want fancy document commands for small documents.  Also, 
the documents are for the screen, not the printer.  Nobody is going to do 
desktop publishing or multimedia in this operating system.

to
