22:10 There shall no stranger eat of the holy thing: a sojourner of
the priest, or an hired servant, shall not eat of the holy thing.

22:11 But if the priest buy any soul with his money, he shall eat of
it, and he that is born in his house: they shall eat of his meat.

22:12 If the priest's daughter also be married unto a stranger, she
may not eat of an offering of the holy things.

22:13 But if the priest's daughter be a widow, or divorced, and have
no child, and is returned unto her father's house, as in her youth,
she shall eat of her father's meat: but there shall be no stranger eat
thereof.

22:14 And if a man eat of the holy thing unwittingly, then he shall
put the fifth part thereof unto it, and shall give it unto the priest
with the holy thing.

mouth of the LORD.

let them live: and the princes of the congregation sware unto them.

What I'm going to avoid is telling what God likes.  God's favorite is the 
Beatles, but that doesn't mean He wants more Beatles (I'm guessing).  Maybe
He 
wants wonderfully original like the Beatles.

God said not to admire the arrogant. He told me Classical music was "poison".

You witnessed God?  Good, we can move on.

I made this operating system on my own initiative.  It is what I'm born to
do. 
 God has claimed it as His temple.  That might not mean what I hope.  I have 
had past projects go no where.

God participated in the design of this operating system.

He said 640x480 16 color, so kids could do offerings.

He said single audio voice.  I guess that means different waveforms are okay.
 
I had HD Audio working, but when I learned it only worked on maybe one in
five 
machines, and not in VMware where it should have... I thought about how 
clusterfucked it made the API.  Once you get the philosophy of this operating 
system, it's obvious HD Audio does not belong.  We are not doing PCI devices.

God said "no child windows".

I am willing to hand-over control to an organization as long as we have a 
100,000 line of code limit.  Also, God said it must be kept perfect.

Two audio drivers would be worse than one audio driver.  It has FAT32 and 
ISO9660, we want to move to just [C:/Doc/RedSea.TXT.Z,1].  We want to get rid
of 
BMP files and make Microsoft support GRA files.

We will put the ugly nasty shit in Windows to keep God's temple pristine.  
Nobody looks at Windows' source.

The future proof BMP and WAV file formats have created like 16 different 
options ....  If a kid wants to sit down and write a BMP or WAV tool, to do
it 
right he hast a huge burden.  Those files are really fucked up.  BMP is so 
fucked up.

----01/20/14 01:44:56----

                                   Demands

When God is manifest to the World and He claims this operating system, 
publically, here's what I want:

* VMware to again support PC Speaker and provide emulation if no PC Speaker
is 
present.

* Windows and Linux will support [C:/Doc/RedSea.TXT.Z,1] RedSea file system
so I can get rid of 2,000 
lines of redundant, blemished code -- FAT32 and ISO9660.  God's temple must
be 
perfect.  I view redundant code that performs the same function as imperfect.
 
More than one filesystem type is bad, not good!

[C:/Kernel/Dsk/FileSysRedSea.CPP.Z,1]
[C:/Kernel/Dsk/FileSysFAT.CPP.Z,1]	:1004
[C:/Kernel/Dsk/FileSysISO1.CPP.Z,1]	:306
[C:/Adam/Boot/DskCDDVD.CPP.Z,1]	:536

* No secure boot.  TempleOS is a additional operating system that must be
used 
along-side Windows or Linux, not as a replacement.  It must dual boot.

* Mandate to PC hardware manufacturers: ATA/ATAPI PIO must work.

* PS2 emulated Keyboard and Mouse must work.  The BIOS must enable these.

* VMware should allow ATAPI to connect real CD/DVD hardware.

* Perhaps, VMware can enable faster than standard x86 IN/OUT instruction 
timing for ATA/ATAPI PIO, so the bandwidth isn't as bad.

* VMware and others should list TempleOS as one of the official 64-bit 
operating systems.

* Windows and Linux should support TempleOS .GRA graphics files.  These are 
just right-side-up .BMP files with 8-bit pixs 4-bits of color and 
transparency, with no palette.  Compression comes from the
[C:/Doc/RedSea.TXT.Z,1] RedSea .Z LZW 
compression.  (Let me know when you want it.)  [C:/Adam/Gr/GrDC.CPP.Z,284]
DCSave(), [C:/Adam/Gr/GrDC.CPP.Z,354] GRAWrite(), [C:/Adam/Gr/GrDC.CPP.Z,323]
DCLoad(), 
and [C:/Adam/Gr/GrDC.CPP.Z,365] GRARead().  [C:/Kernel/Compress.CPP.Z,1]




In other words, all hardware and BIOSes must support TempleOS as a native and 
as a virtual system, dual booted with Windows or Linux.

It would be neat if TempleOS were burned into BIOS ROMs in the factory, or 
maybe Intel CPU chips, in factory!  My hope is that it will be finished and 
largely unchanging for centuries.  I need a good dictionary, first.  Maybe,
we 
leave the dictionary out.

I do not intend to ever support UEFI.  That monstrocity uses elf and various 
propriatary graphics formats.

world to come, 6:6 If they shall fall away, to renew them again unto
repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh,
and put him to an open shame.

receiveth blessing from God: 6:8 But that which beareth thorns and
briers is rejected, and is nigh unto cursing; whose end is to be
burned.


Here's why I make the big bucks.  "For the earth which drinketh in the 
rain..."  They managed to pack the Bible full of praise of Creation.  The 
whole Bible is full of poetic praise of Creation.  Look at the Bible as an 
author.

KingJamesBible (Ecclesiastes 9:2) God says...
and to the wicked; to the good and to the clean, and to the unclean;
to him that sacrificeth, and to him that sacrificeth not: as is the
good, so is the sinner; and he that sweareth, as he that feareth an
oath.

9:3 This is an evil among all things that are done under the sun, that
there is one event unto all: yea, also the heart of the sons of men is
full of evil, and madness is in their heart while they live, and after
that they go to the dead.

9:4 For to him that is joined to all the living there is hope: for a
living dog is better than a dead lion.

9:5 For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any
thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is
forgotten.

9:6 Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now
perished; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any thing
that is done under the sun.

You will suffer justice -- rewards and punishments.

I advise not to mix concerns about justice with your relationship with God.

In otherwords, asking God not to get punished might be futile.  When you love 
God and talk to Him, avoid the temptation to ask for injustice.  Maybe you 
want something, but it's pretty obvious you don't deserve it.

Treat God as a relationship with a person.

I was thinking about the earlier talk of a British Princess who made 
sculptures.  I think about Notre Dame with gargoyles and stuff.  It's
humbling 
how obsessed they were with God.

God likes bears and elephants, both have funny chubby body shapes.  They show 
cheribum as chubby kids.  I like to imagine God likes happy little chubby 
people.  It's a relief that He's not going to impose judgement on being fat. 
He doesn't care -- that gets covered under justice and is unavoidable.  Leave 
your sins apart from your relationship with God, is my advice.

Do not burden God with your sins.  Instead cheer Him up and make Him happy 
with praise.

My operating system has no networking.  I have about 8 different types of 
local file links.  A neat link type is to a symbol in the symbol table.

My links are superior to HTML links.

I have a document format with graphics, links and trees and colors.  When I 
regenerate my website, I make HTML from my documents.  There is a single 
violation of generality in my DOC-->HTML code.  When it converts one of my 
local-sytle-links to a HTML link, it links to my website.  I don't imagine 
anyone takes my operating system so seriously that they are generating 
websites with it.  If so, they can simply change my website name to their 
website.

It seems like magic, how my links get converted.  I place all my source code 
on my website, therefore, when it encounters a local link to source code,
that 
gets converted to the website location of the corresponding source file.

There is no networking, trust me.  I kinda wish I did have networking.  There 
are no PCI devices supported.
