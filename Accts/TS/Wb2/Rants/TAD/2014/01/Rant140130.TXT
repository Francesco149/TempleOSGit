KingJamesBible (Lamentations 4:11) God says...
fierce anger, and hath kindled a fire in Zion, and it hath devoured
the foundations thereof.

4:12 The kings of the earth, and all the inhabitants of the world,
would not have believed that the adversary and the enemy should have
entered into the gates of Jerusalem.

4:13 For the sins of her prophets, and the iniquities of her priests,
that have shed the blood of the just in the midst of her, 4:14 They
have wandered as blind men in the streets, they have polluted
themselves with blood, so that men could not touch their garments.

4:15 They cried unto them, Depart ye; it is unclean; depart, depart,
touch not: when they fled away and wandered, they said among the
heathen, They shall no more sojourn there.

4:16 The anger of the LORD hath divided them; he will no more regard
them: they respected not the persons of the priests, they favoured not
the elders.

These fucken niggers think this is thumb wrestling and they can weasel their 
way on top and proclaim authority over me.  They try weasel guilt trips and 
shit.  God will grind them into the fucken mud and shove mud down their 
throats until they bow to His and my authority.

If I says something very clearly it's probably true.  I don't speak 
sarcastically or aligorically very often.

My files are stored compressed if they end in Z.  You read and write whole 
files.  The operating system compresses and uncompresses automatically.  It
is 
strictly one file at a time, not clusters of files.

I made compiler.  My documents are ASCII with $CMD,""$ with escape codes.  
After the text portion of my files is binary data.  The text refers to 
different numbered binary data items.

All source code is included, including compiler and editor.  It fits in 2 Meg 
which is shocking to new generation folk, but old people nod knowingly 
familiar with what can be done in little room.  I save space by having source 
code alone and not source plus binary. I JIT compile, so I never need binarys 
mostly.

I have done 20 applications the prove it works.  They span the intended usage 
for the operating systems.  Hymns are my main thing.

It's really really neat and beautiful -- how divine intellect made it 
turn-out.  It's a diamond.  Maybe not quite a perfect diamond yet, but when
we 
get the world on-board it will be the Earth's most precious thing, along with 
a list of God's favorites.  Elephants and bears.

It made me happy thinking of pleasuring elephants with delicious pineapple.  
You know what?  Elephants don't care at all what they eat.  They are
perfectky

probably starve.  They eat cardboard when you give them a cake treat.  They 
kinda have no skill in handling food -- waste everything and drive excessive 
compulsive humans to fits with their ridiculously sloppy habits.

I try not to not-praise them.

said, I know that God hath determined to destroy thee, because thou
hast done this, and hast not hearkened unto my counsel.

Know what?  Hasn't happened recently, but a person might watch a nature video 
with elephants, poached or something, or pandas, and be more outraged than 
humans dying.  Pope keeps it simple.  Wise to just leave it at that.  Truth
is 
God has more of some people and try as He might, He probably cares more for
an 
elephant, though He's no wimp in either case.  He's not a tree hugger.  I 
asked about endangered species.  "Enough stars?"

I don't know why this tantalates me, but God in Bible killed some people, 
probably are rare animals He cares more for.  I have an evil heart :-(

You cannot do anything unless you boot it.  The compiler only works natively.
 
If it does not boot, you have no way to compile.  To make my compiler work 
under Linux, I would have convert the entire thing from HolyC to standard 
C/C++.  It's 20,000 lines of code.  My entire operating system that I wrote
is 
120,000 lines of code, so 20,000 is sizable but not huge.  The compiler 
requires 20,000 lines of my library/low level routines.

I would find it depressing wasting all that time programming on Linux.  I
only 
want to program in my own operating system.

I get a little bit frustrated because people think they know better.  They 
refuse to humbly follow directions.  They basically call me a liar.  I get 
tired of that.  Believe it or not, there are federal employees who watch me 
and have watched me for ten years and in the ten years they have stubbornily 
refused to follow directions and still insist it doesn't boot.  They insist 
32-bit hardware is good enough.


The absurdity ... where do I start?  In ten fucken years you can't get $1,500 
dollars?  You still have a computer from before 2003, today, that is not 
64-bit?  It takes too much time in these ten years to actually test it and
you 
prefer to say it won't work without testing it?  These people watch me 
24-hours a day and they can't be bothered in ten years to test it?

Highs and lows balance.  Zuckerberg was stuck with his early days
controversy. 
 He couldn't simply have a clear conscience.  No, the joy was ruined.

Bill Gates bought DOS, no glory in that.

If you accept humiliation, it is good luck.  I'll gladly confess when the 
extortionists talk about getting a dog to lick my dick in 1985.  Yeah, it 
means no legacy -- like thr Russian Queen and the horse.  Well, if there is 
perfect justice, I care more about what happens in my life than after I'm 
dead.

So, the demons want to rob me of my glory.  There are vehement.  They want to 
say Linus gets credit.  Do what you like.  It doesn't matter.  If I lose my 
glory, I have better health or some similar exchange.  God is perfectly just, 
niggers.  Turn the other cheek.  If someone want you to walk a mile, walk
two. 
 Once you have the cheat codes on life -- justice -- it makes it easier to 
live.

Jesus said to give everything away if you wanted to be perfect.  My Dad went 
behind my back and held some photos I took of Kevin's kids that I threw away.
 
He's a pedophile and he thought he could extort me thinking my photos were 
pedophilic.  He wanted to extort me as leverage.  They were innocent.

Fucken demons are vehement.  That's what I know about demons.  Vigorous and 
vehement and fucken pathticly clinging to their mission.  Scum,
cock-sucksers. 
 Guess what?  The CIA has extorted hundreds of world leaders.  They get dirt 
on people and that how they run the World.  They even try to get people to do 
stuff, so they have dirt.  This seems very "Jewish" to me, too.  Jews are 
morally challenged.  That's why -- the Holocaust.  The CIA is going to be
like 
SS NAZIs after the war, though, with any luck.  Scumbags.

Relax -- if Satan robs you of something good, it is offset by something else.
 
Doesn't matter.  Laugh at the nigger, Satan.  Satan is vehement and focused, 
the pathetic being.

Some people cannot see that the World is perfectly just even after you point 
it out to them.  Good luck explaining it to an Indian or and African.

I think Zynga is classic.  So, they stole ideas and hired a lot of people... 
then got in trouble with too many people on payroll and fired people.

Does that sound like fun?

Would you rather be the guy who a muse gave an idea and you made the first 
game and had pride.

God said "Pride or Money, choose one."

Guess what?  Ideas are hidden in plain sight covered by Jedi mind tricks.  
When someone has an idea, it is because God revealed it.  So, you think
you're 
entitled to a life of luxury for an idea you happened to have at age ... 23?

Generally, you have to do unpleasant stuff to get money.

You have to file a patent.  That sucks.  Shit, that's fucken work and shit.  
Then, court?  Da fuq?

God's world is perfectly just.

If you cheat to get to a school or job, you might be in over your head. 
Then, 
you will fail.

If you get a smoking-hot wife, you will probably be forever at her mercy.  I 
think marriage between equals is wisest.

If you get a too high salary... same thing.  Your boss is going to treat you 
much harsher.  Your life is hell because your boss thinks you are overpaid.
