The CIA is afraid of drones, so it is clusterfucking computer science.  Get 
out while you can.  It's too late for me.  I made this operating system 
including a compiler.  The CIA is, now, clusterfucking PCs so it cannot run.  
It ran on computers from 2004-2010, but after that it is clusterfucked.

The CIA and Bill Gates want you to make web pages, not programs.  That's what 
they want computer science to be -- making web pages.  They are destroying
all 
other things.

KingJamesBible (1 Kings 10:29) God says...
10:29 And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred
shekels of silver, and an horse for an hundred and fifty: and so for
all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, did they
bring them out by their means.

11:1 But king Solomon loved many strange women, together with the
daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites,
Zidonians, and Hittites: 11:2 Of the nations concerning which the LORD
said unto the children of Israel, Ye shall not go in to them, neither
shall they come in unto you: for surely they will turn away your heart
after their gods: Solomon clave unto these in love.

11:3 And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred
concubines: and his wives turned away his heart.

11:4 For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, that his wives turned
away his heart after other gods: and his heart was not perfect with
the LORD his God, as was the heart of David his father.

ATMs run XP

I know what that's about.  It is, now, impossible to interface to hardware.  
They do not want drones so they are clusterfucking everything to do with 
computers.  You cannot use a simple RS232 serial port.  XP is the only 
unclusterfucked OS and they are trying to kill it.  It allowed you to access 
the parallel port with your programs.  Now, they have blocked access to all 
hardware ports.  They don't allow digital I/O, either.

I made a parallel port device for the last company I worked for.  It worked
on 
XP but Vista blocked access.  Someone had a work-around but then they stopped 
making parallel and RS232 serial ports.

KingJamesBible (Daniel 4:4) God says...
4:4 I Nebuchadnezzar was at rest in mine house, and flourishing in my
palace: 4:5 I saw a dream which made me afraid, and the thoughts upon
my bed and the visions of my head troubled me.

4:6 Therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon
before me, that they might make known unto me the interpretation of
the dream.

4:7 Then came in the magicians, the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and
the soothsayers: and I told the dream before them; but they did not
make known unto me the interpretation thereof.

4:8 But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name was
Belteshazzar, according to the name of my God, and in whom is the
spirit of the holy gods: and before him I told the dream, saying, 4:9
O Belteshazzar, master of the magicians, because I know that the
spirit of the holy gods is in thee, and no secret troubleth thee, tell
me the visions of my dream that I have seen, and the interpretation
thereof.

                                   Demands

When God is manifest to the World and He claims this operating system, 
publically, here's what I want:

* VMware to again support PC Speaker and provide emulation if no PC Speaker
is 
present.

* Windows and Linux will support [C:/Doc/RedSea.TXT.Z,1] RedSea file system
so I can get rid of 2,000 
lines of redundant, blemished code -- FAT32 and ISO9660.  God's temple must
be 
perfect.  I view redundant code that performs the same function as imperfect.
 
More than one filesystem type is bad, not good!

[C:/Kernel/Dsk/FileSysRedSea.CPP.Z,1]
[C:/Kernel/Dsk/FileSysFAT.CPP.Z,1]	:1004
[C:/Kernel/Dsk/FileSysISO1.CPP.Z,1]	:306
[C:/Adam/Boot/DskCDDVD.CPP.Z,1]	:536

* No secure boot.  TempleOS is a additional operating system that must be
used 
along-side Windows or Linux, not as a replacement.  It must dual boot.

* Mandate to PC hardware manufacturers: ATA/ATAPI PIO must work.

* PS2 emulated Keyboard and Mouse must work.  The BIOS must enable these.

* VMware should allow ATAPI to connect real CD/DVD hardware.

* Perhaps, VMware can enable faster than standard x86 IN/OUT instruction 
timing for ATA/ATAPI PIO, so the bandwidth isn't as bad.

* VMware and others should list TempleOS as one of the official 64-bit 
operating systems.

* Windows and Linux should support TempleOS .GRA graphics files.  These are 
just right-side-up .BMP files with 8-bit pixs 4-bits of color and 
transparency, with no palette.  Compression comes from the
[C:/Doc/RedSea.TXT.Z,1] RedSea .Z LZW 
compression.  (Let me know when you want it.)  [C:/Adam/Gr/GrDC.CPP.Z,284]
DCSave(), [C:/Adam/Gr/GrDC.CPP.Z,354] GRAWrite(), [C:/Adam/Gr/GrDC.CPP.Z,323]
DCLoad(), 
and [C:/Adam/Gr/GrDC.CPP.Z,365] GRARead().  [C:/Kernel/Compress.CPP.Z,1]




In other words, all hardware and BIOSes must support TempleOS as a native and 
as a virtual system, dual booted with Windows or Linux.

It would be neat if TempleOS were burned into BIOS ROMs in the factory, or 
maybe Intel CPU chips, in factory!  My hope is that it will be finished and 
largely unchanging for centuries.  I need a good dictionary, first.  Maybe,
we 
leave the dictionary out.

I do not intend to ever support UEFI.  That monstrocity uses elf and various 
propriatary graphics formats.

24:24 And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre,

all that the prophets have spoken: 24:26 Ought not Christ to have
suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?  24:27 And
beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all
the scriptures the things concerning himself.

took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him from among the king's
sons which were slain; and they hid him, even him and his nurse, in
the bedchamber from Athaliah, so that he was not slain.

11:3 And he was with her hid in the house of the LORD six years. And
Athaliah did reign over the land.

11:4 And the seventh year Jehoiada sent and fetched the rulers over
hundreds, with the captains and the guard, and brought them to him
into the house of the LORD, and made a covenant with them, and took an
oath of them in the house of the LORD, and shewed them the king's son.

do; A third part of you that enter in on the sabbath shall even be
keepers of the watch of the king's house; 11:6 And a third part shall
