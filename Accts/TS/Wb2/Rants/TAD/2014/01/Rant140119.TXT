KingJamesBible (Jeremiah 23:17) God says...
23:17 They say still unto them that despise me, The LORD hath said, Ye
shall have peace; and they say unto every one that walketh after the
imagination of his own heart, No evil shall come upon you.

23:18 For who hath stood in the counsel of the LORD, and hath
perceived and heard his word? who hath marked his word, and heard it?
23:19 Behold, a whirlwind of the LORD is gone forth in fury, even a
grievous whirlwind: it shall fall grievously upon the head of the
wicked.

23:20 The anger of the LORD shall not return, until he have executed,
and till he have performed the thoughts of his heart: in the latter
days ye shall consider it perfectly.

23:21 I have not sent these prophets, yet they ran: I have not spoken
to them, yet they prophesied.

23:22 But if they had stood in my counsel, and had caused my people to
hear my words, then they should have turned them from their evil way,

start-ups at Y-Combinator are a commodity?

In past ages, the upper class had a chattering social scene.  You can imagine 
how dull women's gossiping would be.  This paper folding seems like it fits 
right into the atheist-IQ-evolution-computer-science points of achievement.

The paper folding is neat but I'm not in the mood -- it seems too typical of 
the atheist-evolution-loving-IQ-loving..., like a math theorem, "Congrats,
you 
get points for making a useless original math theorem."  Somebody comes-up 
with a new math based on complex numbers as fractions.

The paper folding looks cool as art, but when sold as "no ink", they are 
selling it as an IQ-originality-point-scored, not a beautiful artistic thing.

God is perfectly just.  If you are a bad child, God will punish you when you 
become a parant.

You might be hot shit when you are young.  You might hit 40 and not be able
to 
get a job.

You might be at a crossroads in life.  Perhaps, your manager will 
inadvertently give you skills needed later.

All my jobs werew CIA false front companies.  It's as silly as arguing when 
reality is the Truman Show.

God is perfectly just.  Be aware that your actions when you are young 
determine what happens when you are old.  Highs and lows balance.  Pride 
before a fall and humility before honors.  If you carry your cross with this 
new manager, you will get the glory of Christ, later.

You enter the time for the minute in question as a Unix time-number.  You go

fountains of water, and unto all brooks: peradventure we may find
grass to save the horses and mules alive, that we lose not all the
beasts.

went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself.

him shall not be confounded.

2:7 Unto you therefore which believe he is precious: but unto them
which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the
same is made the head of the corner, 2:8 And a stone of stumbling, and
a rock of offence, even to them which stumble at the word, being
disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed.

2:9 But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy
nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of
him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light;

God: which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.

Do you know how the last 20% of a job takes 80% of the effort?

Suppose we are talking about make a system that won't crash.  If you have
done 
multitasking, you know that you frequently have to add nasty code for 
outrageously rare events, that you are not even sure can occur.  Code might
be 
3 times bigger just due to paranoid defensive programming.

You do code for absurdly stupid users -- deleting a directory while having a 
process still in that directory.  Editing the file in multiple windows and 
getting confused?  I happen to like having two task edit the same file --
last 
one to save wins!

"Failure is not an option", is thinking like a titanic.  I think like a
kayak. 
 Mine reboots fast.  There is brainwashing about DOS and the C64 which had no 
protections and had RESET switches on the machines.  A reset switch was no
big 
deal.  It's not like we suffered.  I don't ever remember crashes bothering me.

We are not a primary operating system like Windows, we are a special purpose 
OS that must dual boot because no Internet is not acceptible.

Windows & Linux decided it must be able to do everything a home user or
mobile 
user or server user might want.  I say, "Let's not do everything."  I can cut 
80% of my code by not doing a few things.

Compiler authors go to extreme lengths for just tiny improvments.  They go to 
extreme lengths for absurd optimizations only stupid programmers would
benefit 
from.

By allowing crashes, I cut code by an order of magnitude;  By not doing every 
functionality, I cut code by a an order of magnitude.  By doing just one 
driver and least common denominator, I cut code by three orders of magnitude.
 
Windows will support a 6 speaker three screen system.

Windows and Visual Studio are 100,000,000 lines of code.  Mine is 100,000 
lines of code.

I am confident I can pass-on my vision to others today and future generations 
by having a limit on lines of code -- 100,000.  Here's what will happen: A 
person who's been trained in conventional failure-is-not-an-option thinking 
will say, "Hey! This code is faulty!"  I will say, "You have to eliminate 100 
lines of code if you wish to add 100 lines of code."  Now, he will pause and 
say, "You know what?  That's a silly case that will never happen in reality."

I do not check for buffer overrun attacks.  I do not check for users 
maliciously crashing it by running it out of memory.

My vision was a Commodore 64.  Linux is a 1970's main frame operating system.

The most important thing for a mainframe is not crashing because other users 
would be outraged in a computer lab.  It is also important to multitask well 
with priorities and stuff.

Mine will multi-task, but it doesn't share resources very well.  One task
hogs 
the disk drive until it is done.

You have to smack the Jedi-mind-tricked niggers who seem to think playing two 
video games at once is the most important thing that needs to be done.  And 
they would be horribly ashamed if their system did not play two games at
once. 
 That deep shame is their biggest concern.

With mine, you can play two video games at once, probably... but there is 
nothing keeping one from hogging God-knows-what resource if a malicious
remote 
user is attacking trying to cause a crash.  (I don't worry about malicious 
users.)

Do you not know how much effort goes into stopping buffer overflows from
crazy 
malicious intruders?  Do you not know how much effort goes into ensuring no 
video game hogs any particular resource?

Mine does master/slave multicore.  I made an 8 core flight simulator.  It is 
impossible to do real-time multicore if you do not know how many cores the
job 
needs to be divided between.  You could divide into micro-jobs but that's too 
inefficent.  Trust-me, it's hard enough getting a net positive improvement 
with multicore.

What I do is... during each refresh cycle, core#0 assigns a job of drawing 
some portion of the screen (which it carefully analyses by looking at CPU 
loading for that core the last refresh) to core #1 #2 #3 #4 #5 #6 #7.

With SMP, how would you know how many cores you have?  Lets say you find-out 
how many cores -- it will be hard because they try to hide that.  Then, you 
fork 7 times.  The scheduler decides what core to place the task.  You better 
pray it doesn't put two tasks on one core!  Guess what happens 15+15mS until 
it finishes? With a 60fps cycle, you divide-up the task of drawing the screen 
into 8 pieces, each of which ideally takes 15mS since 16.6 is 60Hz.  If there 
are two jobs assigned to one core, the refresh is delayed 30mS instead of 
15mS.

When you design an airplane wing, you make it 150% of spec, not 1000% of
spec. 
 Our schools do not teach the concept of overengineering in software.  
Overengineering is a sign of a bad engineer.

A 100,000 line of code project differs from a 100,000,000 line project.  You 
can use short variable names, you can use global variables, you only need one 
namespace.  You do not need a linker -- just #include all your files.  You do 
not need make.  I can compile 50,000 lines of code in one second.  

It is exceedingly difficult to keep a clear head and not respond "We must 
design it to grow and scale."

God's temple must be perfect.  We will ALWAYS break compatibility.  We will 
never design for bigger-than-now.  We should design like "today is the final 
design for God's temple for the next thousand years, set in stone."  I do not 
put a version number in my GRAphics file.  BMP has future-proof design and
now 
it is ridiculously grotesquely complicated.  WAV is grotesque.  Is it
possible 
to design a 3rd party tool to process all possible WAV and BMP files?

Why do you put-up with the shit you are served?

On the Apple II, at the command line:

>HGR
>HCOLOR=16
>HLINE 100,100 TO 200,200

In TempleOS, at the command line:

>gr_dc->color=RED;
>GrCircle(gr_dc,100,100,100);

I made about 20 applications to demo the operating system.  None is bigger 
than 2000 lines of code.  Guess what?  Global variables are wonderful.

20:30 Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said unto
him, Thou son of the perverse rebellious woman, do not I know that
thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thine own confusion, and unto the
confusion of thy mother's nakedness?  20:31 For as long as the son of
Jesse liveth upon the ground, thou shalt not be established, nor thy
kingdom. Wherefore now send and fetch him unto me, for he shall surely
die.

20:32 And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto him,
Wherefore shall he be slain? what hath he done?  20:33 And Saul cast a
javelin at him to smite him: whereby Jonathan knew that it was
determined of his father to slay David.

20:34 So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did eat no
meat the second day of the month: for he was grieved for David,
because his father had done him shame.

20:35 And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into
the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad with him.

Why do you like OSDev-ing?  Could it be you like ring-0 programming?  My 
Commodore 64 was a toy and I played with all the neat stuff that is 
off-limits, today.

My generation learned how to make binary pixel numbers for sprites in BASIC 
programs.   Bill Gates says, "That was the bad-old days!  You young people
are 
so much more lucky --  you get to pick from 100 different fonts and make HTML 
pages."

I began with the notion, "All programmers like ring-0."  Find a single 
programmer who does not think low level instructions are sexy and fun!  All 
programmers lust for the neat off-limits instruction you get in RING-0.

Once I decided on ring-0, I sure as hell was not giving up my advantage in 
speed from not changing privilege levels!  I haven't even glanced at
SYSENTER/ 
SYSCALL/ SYSEXIT.  There are better than software interrupts or call gates, 
perhaps, but obviously slower than CALL REL32?  It's obvious CALL REL32 is
the 
fastest -- no need to look further!

It's a stange thought to think about what century you'd like to be born in.  
The wise thing might be not to have a preference.  I think I'm glad we don't 
do much physical labor.  I taped drywall two summers.  I don't know how to 
describe it.  As I think about it, I had some times as an engineer when I 
might have prefered drywall.  Not really?

When I was an engineer, I got to wire-wrap glue logic to hook-up DIP chips. 
I 
think that has vanished!  I really really liked doing that.

My whole life, I tried to build-up my skill-set.  I have skills in hardware 
and software.  If I had my choice, I would like to connect my operating
system 
to wire-wrapped little microcontroller boards, just like I did 15 years ago, 
LOL.

There are a couple things wrong -- that whole scene is gone.  

I was always so focused on building tools...  I always assumed I could
cash-in 
and make useful products.  The truth is, I only had ideas for tools and not 
products made with tools.  I was kind of like a communist who always did 
infrastructure and never consumer goods.

Here's a perfect example of where I miscalculated  (but didn't spend any 
time).  FPGAs seem really neat and powerful -- they can do so much, right?  
FPGAs are only good for digital filters.  I guess you could do GPUs with
them, 
but that does not sound like fun!  In other words, it is easy to wrongly
think 
they can surely do all kinds of neat stuff.

I think most people have no clue about multicore, but I acquired a clue.  I 
have actually used multicore.

My generation grew-up when the game industry was starting.  Every day, a 
totally new kind of game was developped.  We had Donkey Kong and games of
that 
era, then 1993 we had first person shooters like Doom.  

My generation thinks video games are unlimited -- there will always be new
and 
exciting games, right?  The thinking process is flawed in the same way "you 
should always design for the future product expanding and growing in scale."

Cars have mostly settled-down into normal pattern, though I have seen 3 wheel 
cars.

I get furious at the India-niggers (I have a vivid impression) who say "let's 
not work on that anymore, that industry is done with innovation."  Did you
see 
the guy who spoke as though Linux operating system was the only one
possible!! 
Somebody actually drew the memory model with virtual memory Linux and said
you 
have to have virtual memory for multitasking.  Can you believe that!  "You 
have to have virtual memory for multitasking."

I don't like a stupid person pronouncing innovation dead in a field when that 
person is certainly not qualified, though it might be possible he's right.

I'm furious at all the lies I see.

Gates is more or less saying, "We don't need programmers.  We have Word 
processors, spread sheets, browsers, first person shooters.  That's all there 
will ever be.  People, let's move on to other things.  These are not the 
droids you are looking for."

My memory is fragmented.  That's life.  You will be doing 640x480 16 color 
graphics, probably not movies.  You will have enough memory.  My operating 
system has 20 applications that prove it works for its intended purpose.  If 
it doesn't work, use Windows.  Whatever you tried to do is not its intended 
purpose.

Forget what you know about "kernel memory".  

Adam (Eve) is the first task.  Tasks inherit symbols from parents.  Adam puts 
all the headers and JIT boot code into his memory and symbol table.  All
tasks 
are sons of Adam and get his symbols without needing to #include headers.

The command-line feeds into a HolyC compiler and function by function it is 
compiled and placed into memory.  You know how the AppleII and C64 could
store 
BASIC code if had a line num or execute a BASIC statement immediately.  
TempleOS has HolyC instead of BASIC.

It's really simple and elegant.  Adam runs this script like AutoExec.BAT.  

[C:/Kernel/Adam1.CPP.Z,1]

That compiles headers for the 50,000 LOC in /Kernel and /Compiler

Then, everything in the /Adam directory gets compiled during boot.
[C:/Adam/Adam2.CPP.Z,1]

That finishes by jumping into the account directory and compiling Adam3.

There is no PATH.  If a file is not found, the parent directories are 
searched.  This enables default account files in account parent directories.

This is an hard saying; who can hear it?  6:61 When Jesus knew in
himself that his disciples murmured at it, he said unto them, Doth
this offend you?  6:62 What and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend
up where he was before?  6:63 It is the spirit that quickeneth; the
flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are
spirit, and they are life.


Adam has a heap that is never destroyed.  If you wish to add a library, tell 
Adam to compile it and it will put the code in his heap and the symbols in
his 
table and everybody will inherit and it will not be orphaned (and freed) when 
some task dies since Adam never dies.  Adam's memory is like kernel memory.

KingJamesBible (Jeremiah 51:46) God says...
51:46 And lest your heart faint, and ye fear for the rumour that shall
be heard in the land; a rumour shall both come one year, and after
that in another year shall come a rumour, and violence in the land,
ruler against ruler.

51:47 Therefore, behold, the days come, that I will do judgment upon
the graven images of Babylon: and her whole land shall be confounded,
and all her slain shall fall in the midst of her.

51:48 Then the heaven and the earth, and all that is therein, shall
sing for Babylon: for the spoilers shall come unto her from the north,
saith the LORD.

51:49 As Babylon hath caused the slain of Israel to fall, so at
Babylon shall fall the slain of all the earth.

51:50 Ye that have escaped the sword, go away, stand not still:
remember the LORD afar off, and let Jerusalem come into your mind.

that he was a just man and an holy, and observed him; and when he
heard him, he did many things, and heard him gladly.

6:21 And when a convenient day was come, that Herod on his birthday
made a supper to his lords, high captains, and chief estates of
Galilee; 6:22 And when the daughter of the said Herodias came in, and
danced, and pleased Herod and them that sat with him, the king said
unto the damsel, Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt, and I will give it
thee.

You know what?  I really don't like liberal militant women.  There are some 
wicked women in the liberal media.  Maybe, they're lesbiens.  Just below the 
surface they are fuming and wishing for dead babies.  All day long they think 
about dead babies and eugenics.  God said that class of people is "vain".  
It's not their face they admire in the mirror -- all day long they say, "I'm 
smart.  I should reproduce.  I'm smart."  If you need some help understanding 
vanity, it's just like saying, "I'm so handsome.  Shucks, I really am 
handsome." to the mirror.

It doesn't help with Catholics provoking them.  I'm a spectator.

27:12 Behold, all ye yourselves have seen it; why then are ye thus
altogether vain?  27:13 This is the portion of a wicked man with God,
and the heritage of oppressors, which they shall receive of the
Almighty.

27:14 If his children be multiplied, it is for the sword: and his
offspring shall not be satisfied with bread.

27:15 Those that remain of him shall be buried in death: and his
widows shall not weep.

Oh, come-on!  In sports it's very obvious the Catholic have committed a 
technical foul--you don't think you'll get away with it!  God is a God of 
truth.

KingJamesBible (Ezekiel 33:24) God says...
the land is given us for inheritance.

33:25 Wherefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Ye eat with
the blood, and lift up your eyes toward your idols, and shed blood:
and shall ye possess the land?  33:26 Ye stand upon your sword, ye
work abomination, and ye defile every one his neighbour's wife: and
shall ye possess the land?  33:27 Say thou thus unto them, Thus saith
the Lord GOD; As I live, surely they that are in the wastes shall fall
by the sword, and him that is in the open field will I give to the
beasts to be devoured, and they that be in the forts and in the caves
shall die of the pestilence.

33:28 For I will lay the land most desolate, and the pomp of her
strength shall cease; and the mountains of Israel shall be desolate,
that none shall pass through.

33:29 Then shall they know that I am the LORD, when I have laid the
land most desolate because of all their abominations which they have
committed.

These are not prophetic, usually, but it is God's attitude.

I'll talk about my compiler.

Mine is based on a stack-machine expression evaluator that got morphed into
an 
optimizing compiler.

My compiler course taught me to make a Lex() function.  It strips comments, 
puts identifiers and strings together, inputs integers and floating numbers 
and handles multicharacter operators.

The first thing you learn about Lex() is how you uses it.  Imagine it as a 
tool in your hand and you have to get used to the heft and feel of Lex().  
Basically, you keep Lex() pointing one token ahead of where you currently are 
sitting.

You have a GetChar one level lower than Lex().  You need to be able to
back-up 
one character.  It's tricky using this with these two limitations.  You'll 
find sitting Lex() one token ahead is sometimes rough.  Backing-up a
character 
is sometimes tricky -- imagine #include and stuff.

Normally, you do a preprocessor.  I was, perhaps, foolishly taught to avoid 
extra passes, so I did mine # preprocessor commands as part of Lex().

I make allowances for unlimited string but not identifier length I think.  I 
allow <NewLine> in my strings, just because I can.

I made my character constant accept multiple chars.  You probably want 
unicode.

'AB' == 0x4241

A modern compiler should just do unicode, but not mine cause I hate that! 
Fucke'em.

Since I have a JIT mode, I made a preprocessor #exe{} that executes any kind 
of code during compile and Stream() it into the flow of characters going into 
Lex().

If it is the command-line feeding into my compiler, I fill a buffer from the 
command-line, and wait for more when I run out, so line-by-line it feeds into 
the compiler from the command-line and function-by-function it gets compiled.

The expression evaluator is the hardest thing, except for crazy optimizations 
I don't bother with.  In my compiler course we learned parsing but nothing on 
the backend.  If you know assembly I guess you can figure-out the back end... 
but crazy optimizations might be taught.  I didn't do crazy optimizations 
because I think C is trivially transformed to assembly without ever getting 
crazy doing common sub expressions and stuff.

Recursive descent is pretty awful effeciency-wise.  I make a level for each 
operator that tells how high its precidence is.  I changed from the standard
C 
precidence rules cause they're not good.  Left and right associativity gets 
tricky, naw not really.

When you are parsing an expression, create an operator stack.  I originally 
used the system stack, but that was foolish.  You have to bite the bullet and 
make a stack datastructure.  As you parse, you push operators and each new 
binary operator you compare back up the stack... if the new one is higher 
precidence, you do it right away.  If lower precidence than what's on the 
stack, you pop the stack (multiple times, comparing)  You'll figure it out -- 
you need a stack and you need an integer telling what precidence score each 
operator is.

I produce a stack-machine expression evaluator output, just like the floating 
point x86 FPU.

You have to deal with datatypes.  My beautiful little technique suddenly got 
ugly.  It turns-out I have to more-or-less regenerate AST abstract symbol 
trees, however mine is nice because I have a start-to-end stream of 
instructions which you sometimes want to traverse in instruction order and 
other times in stack machine order.

You make a while instruction NEW a LABEL, you do your while stuff.  You
insert 
the LABEL you NEWED earlier into the stream.

It turns out you have to cut and paste chunks of code for FOR statements.  I 
have a way of PUSHING the intermediate-code I have currently generated and 
temporarily starting with new code, then POPING and APPENDING and stuff. 
It's 
an ugly detail.

Early on, I had an interpretor with a big SWITCH statement.  Once you get
that 
working, you can obviously IN-LINE the chunks of code for each 
intermediate-code-instruction and patch them to make immediates and stuff.  
Converting from an interpretor to a true compiler wasn't at all difficult for 
me.

Keep in mind, my started very unoptimized.

Well I made a hash table for function names, class names, #define macro
names, 
global variable names.  Making a JIT compiler is actually much easier than 
making a binary.  When you call a prior function, you look-up in the symbol 
table for that function name and you have it's execution address waiting. 
You 
just make the code in memory you malloc.  I merge code and data and allow
user 
execution, so mine is really easy.  I just malloc() space for a function
after 
I work-out how big it is.

My assembler reuses almost all the C routines and my asm syntax is
practically 
C.

For AOT code you make a binary and store import names and export names.  It
is 
harder to make AOT than JIT.

My optimizer has about 9 passes.  0,1,2 are for simplifying constant 
expressions and figuring-out datatypes.

My register allocation was just looking at frequency of different local 
variable offsets and assigning to most frequent offests, so long as nothing 
disqualified.  Long 64-bit mode is nice with 16 64-bit registers.  I don't 
aggresively use my regs for ABI argument passing.  It turns-out R12 and R13 
have irregular translation to machine code, so I don't do pointers with those 
regs.  R12 and R13 can be used for nonpointer integers.

So, you get to the back-end.  I made a policy that each of my intermediate 
instructions was free to trash RAX,RBX,RCX,RDX.  I made so RAX was the top of 
the floating point stack, so it served to couple together all my intermediate 
codes.

Floating point was lots of work.  I eventually optimized for it not to push 
and pop unnecessarily.  My intermediate codes have a INPUT-CONVERSION or a 
RESULT Conversion flag.  If it needs int-to-float or float-to-int, I set a 
flag.

My original scheme involved a fixed array for my intermediate codes, so I did 
not insert or delete, I changed them to NOP.  Eventually, I changed to 
free-floating memory nodes linked together.  The reason for array was hunger 
for efficency, not calling so many MALLOCs, for example.

My backend decides if it can use long or short JMP instructions.  My policy
is 
that on each pass, it is only allowed to make the code smaller.  That way, if 
it is decided it is short JMP, it will never be changed so it needs long.

I only support X86_64.  My assembler supports somewhat of 16 and most of 32 
bit.  I do not support MMX or SSE.

KingJamesBible (Jeremiah 48:38) God says...
48:38 There shall be lamentation generally upon all the housetops of
Moab, and in the streets thereof: for I have broken Moab like a vessel
wherein is no pleasure, saith the LORD.

48:39 They shall howl, saying, How is it broken down! how hath Moab
turned the back with shame! so shall Moab be a derision and a
dismaying to all them about him.

48:40 For thus saith the LORD; Behold, he shall fly as an eagle, and
shall spread his wings over Moab.

48:41 Kerioth is taken, and the strong holds are surprised, and the
mighty men's hearts in Moab at that day shall be as the heart of a
woman in her pangs.

48:42 And Moab shall be destroyed from being a people, because he hath
magnified himself against the LORD.

48:43 Fear, and the pit, and the snare, shall be upon thee, O
inhabitant of Moab, saith the LORD.

How would you guys like a lecture on something.  It'd be better if I had some 
work to do.  Let's just get God to talk about dinosaurs.

Did any dinosaurs have fancy colors for mating?  If they did, it would be
lost 
to history.  Tragic.

KingJamesBible (Deuteronomy 10:22) God says...
10:22 Thy fathers went down into Egypt with threescore and ten
persons; and now the LORD thy God hath made thee as the stars of
heaven for multitude.

11:1 Therefore thou shalt love the LORD thy God, and keep his charge,
and his statutes, and his judgments, and his commandments, alway.

11:2 And know ye this day: for I speak not with your children which
have not known, and which have not seen the chastisement of the LORD
your God, his greatness, his mighty hand, and his stretched out arm,
11:3 And his miracles, and his acts, which he did in the midst of
Egypt unto Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and unto all his land; 11:4 And
what he did unto the army of Egypt, unto their horses, and to their
chariots; how he made the water of the Red sea to overflow them as
they pursued after you, and how the LORD hath destroyed them unto this
day; 11:5 And what he did unto you in the wilderness, until ye came
into this place; 11:6 And what he did unto Dathan and Abiram, the sons
of Eliab, the son of Reuben: how the earth opened her mouth, and
swallowed them up, and their households, and their tents, and all the
substance that was in their possession, in the midst of all Israel:

In computer science, rational number are occassionally stored as integer 
numerator and denominator and all computation is done with rationals.  You 
could use complex.

After thinking about C++ operator overloading, unless it's math and the 
operators are already established like for matrices, it's a bad idea.  
Operator overloading is good for complex, matrices, extended precision...

Damn, I like my compiler.  I have a fucken Carry flag!  That rocks.

Did you know you can do this?



class CTask
{
$=-0x80;
  CTask *next,last;

...

  I64 win_top,win_left,win_bottom,Win_right;
  U0 pad;
#assert !($&7)
}





You can change the position counter, like an ASM structure.
You can use negative offsets to capitalize on x86_64 signed BYTE 
displacements.
Instead of "void" you have U0, which has size zero.
#assert is a preprocessor (chuckle)  



"Hello World"; //String by itself goes to STDOUT as a printf().

Ticketmaster taught me the negative displacement optimization.  I don't use 
it.

1:13 From above hath he sent fire into my bones, and it prevaileth

of me: he hath called an assembly against me to crush my young men:
the LORD hath trodden the virgin, the daughter of Judah, as in a
winepress.

water, because the comforter that should relieve my soul is far from
me: my children are desolate, because the enemy prevailed.
