An OSDev guy talked about separating space for data variables from out of a 
flat binary.  The only reason that I agree with is smaller flat binary files 
size is better.  The down-side is more complexity.  I made
[C:/Kernel/Adam1a.HPP.Z,3573] CSysFixedArea with 
my page tables and enough other stuff to make it worthwhile.

I was able to make my [C:/Kernel/Mem1a.CPP.Z,1] Page Table Setup code much
more readable and flexible.  
It also turns-out that I was also able to merge code for zeroing-out items 
into one big zeroing-out operation.

KingJamesBible: God says...
126:2 Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with
singing: then said they among the heathen, The LORD hath done great
things for them.

126:3 The LORD hath done great things for us; whereof we are glad.

126:4 Turn again our captivity, O LORD, as the streams in the south.

126:5 They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.

126:6 He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall
doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him.



127:1 Except the LORD build the house, they labour in vain that build
it: except the LORD keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain.

I wrote my compiler and assembler.  It is 20,000 lines of code.

I don't have a linker.  Normally, you use JIT compilation.  The AOT is for
the 
kenrl and the compiler BIN files.  When my compiler finds a global variable, 
it leaves some space in the BIN file.  I don't have segmentation support in 
16-bit asm, so you have to do it by hand.  You have no business in 16 bit 
code.  My operating system is 64-bit and the 16-bit real mode is for booting 
only.

I told you I wrote every line of code including my compiler, dumb fuck.

A CSprite, is an ordered list of [C:/Adam/Gr/Gr.CPP.Z,15] these elements,
created with <CTRL-R>.  
Normally, they are packed together in a list and the address of the first is 
passed to routines.

See [C:/Demo/Graphics/SpritePlot.CPP.Z,1],
[C:/Demo/Graphics/SpritePlot3D.CPP.Z,1] and 
[C:/Demo/Graphics/SpritePut.CPP.Z,1] and [C:/Adam/Gr/SpriteMesh.CPP.Z,871]
SpriteMesh().

Be aware that copying SP, IB, or IS entries with the clipboard results in 
duplicate entries with different nums.  You can manually remove dups by 
editing with <CTRL-T> and setting to the original num.

See [C:/Adam/Gr/GrSpritePlot.CPP.Z,1] ::/Adam/Gr/GrSpritePlot.CPP for how
CSprite are stored.

Graphics/Math/3D Transformation
[C:/Kernel/Adam1a.HPP.Z,3220] CDC's have a 4x4 matrix for rotating, scaling,
skewing and shifting in 3 
dimensions.  To make the graphics routines respond to the transformation, you 
must set the [C:/Kernel/Adam1a.HPP.Z,3188] DCF_TRANSFORMATION flag.

The matrix consists of integers that have been scaled 32 bits
([C:/Adam/Gr/GrDC.CPP.Z,4] gr_scale).  See 
[C:/Demo/Lectures/FixedPoint.CPP.Z,1] to learn why.

See [C:/Adam/Gr/MathGr.CPP.Z,83] GrRotXNew(), [C:/Adam/Gr/MathGr.CPP.Z,99]
GrRotYNew(), [C:/Adam/Gr/MathGr.CPP.Z,115] GrRotZNew(),
[C:/Adam/Gr/MathGr.CPP.Z,131] GrScaleNew(), [C:/Adam/Gr/MathGr.CPP.Z,159]
GrRotXEqu(), 
[C:/Adam/Gr/MathGr.CPP.Z,179] GrRotYEqu(), [C:/Adam/Gr/MathGr.CPP.Z,199]
GrRotZEqu() and [C:/Adam/Gr/MathGr.CPP.Z,219] GrScaleEqu() to rotate about
axes and scale.  
Combine them with [C:/Adam/Gr/MathGr.CPP.Z,140] GrMulMat() and assign them to
the [C:/Kernel/Adam1a.HPP.Z,3220] CDC.dc with [C:/Adam/Gr/GrDC.CPP.Z,47]
GrSetRotMat(). 
 See [C:/Demo/Graphics/Box.CPP.Z,1].

You can rotate single points using [C:/Adam/Gr/GrDC.CPP.Z,6] GrRot().

The 4th dimension allows a neat trick where you can place pos shifts 
(translations), into the matrix and [C:/Adam/Gr/MathGr.CPP.Z,140] GrMulMat
them to combine rotation/shift 
operations.  Normally, you can't combine pos shift operations.  See 
[C:/Adam/Gr/MathGr.CPP.Z,240] GrSetTranslation() and
[C:/Demo/Graphics/Transform.CPP.Z,1].

Finally, [C:/Kernel/Adam1a.HPP.Z,3220] CDC's have an x, y and z which is an
additional shift (translation).

The transformation is implemented as a callback on the
[C:/Kernel/Adam1a.HPP.Z,3220] CDC's transform() 
member.  The default transfrom() callback is [C:/Adam/Gr/GrDC.CPP.Z,16]
GrTransform().  See 
[C:/Demo/Games/EagleDive.CPP.Z,1] or
[C:/Demo/Games/CastleFrankenstein.CPP.Z,1] to see how 
to change the transfrom() callback for foreshortening.

I am able to create a fixed size 128 Gig address space with page tables
