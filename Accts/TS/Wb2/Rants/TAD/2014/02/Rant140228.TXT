My operating system is not networked, so there is not a malicious presence.  
Mostly, my vision is that you don't use many 3rd party items.  It is safe, so 
it can be unprotected.  DOS was unprotected.

In Windows or Linux, you separate code and data for protection.  You only set 
the execute bit on code.  My compiler compiles one function at a time.  The 
string constants and floating point constants and jump table offsets are 
placed right after the code.  When you declare a global variable in a BIN 
module, it just skips a few bytes.  

I do not set and unset the execute bit.

I have a "code heap" and "data heap" however.  The data heap is for MAlloc, 
but I make extra heavy use of MAlloc since my stack cannot grow and MAlloc is 
safer.  Basically, don't have the habit of putting large items on the stack.

I put all code in the lowest 2 Gig of memory so I can use signed 32-bit 
addressing mode for CALL.

If you disagree with me, you are simply WRONG.

the cities of Judah, and the chief of the fathers of Israel, and they
came to Jerusalem.

23:3 And all the congregation made a covenant with the king in the
house of God. And he said unto them, Behold, the king's son shall
reign, as the LORD hath said of the sons of David.

23:4 This is the thing that ye shall do; A third part of you entering
on the sabbath, of the priests and of the Levites, shall be porters of

Mizpah cast about and returned, and went unto Johanan the son of
Kareah.

41:15 But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight
men, and went to the Ammonites.

41:16 Then took Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the

recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, from Mizpah, after that
he had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, even mighty men of war, and
the women, and the children, and the eunuchs, whom he had brought
again from Gibeon: 41:17 And they departed, and dwelt in the

3:5 And I said, Let them set a fair mitre upon his head. So they set a

and I should heal them.
