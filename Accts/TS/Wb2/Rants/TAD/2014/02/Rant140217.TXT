was dead, they fled.

17:52 And the men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and

gates of Ekron.

And the wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim,

17:53 And the children of Israel returned from chasing after the
Philistines, and they spoiled their tents.

17:54 And David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to
Jerusalem; but he put his armour in his tent.

17:55 And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said
unto Abner, the captain of the host, Abner, whose son is this youth?
And Abner said, As thy soul liveth, O king, I cannot tell.

A manned space mission is an order of magnitude more code.

We cut an order of magnitude by allowing crashes.  The included applications 
(games) and hymns represent the entire usage this is designed for.  During
the 
1980's, home users enjoyed C64's while NASA worked on VAXes or something.  In 
recent times, everybody has switched to mainframe capable operating systems.

We cut an order of magnitude by not covering all usage cases.  Whole files
are 
loaded and saved, files are stored contiguously and do not grow.  You can do 
raw block access, if you like.

This is a kayak, not a titanic.  We don't want bugs, but we're not worried 
about somebody deleting a directory while another task is inside it.

Other operating systems bend-over-backward to optimize for playing two video 
games at once.

Today, I discovered my GodDoodle has a problem when some window with the 
"ON_TOP" flag is maximized and covering the whole fucken screen.  Gets 
ridiculous.  I might have to do something because it is probably someone will 
do a doodle with the splash screen window.  Maybe, I get rid of the ON-TOP 
flag from that spash.

KingJamesBible (Daniel 4:7) God says...
the soothsayers: and I told the dream before them; but they did not
make known unto me the interpretation thereof.

4:8 But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name was
Belteshazzar, according to the name of my God, and in whom is the
spirit of the holy gods: and before him I told the dream, saying, 4:9
O Belteshazzar, master of the magicians, because I know that the
spirit of the holy gods is in thee, and no secret troubleth thee, tell
me the visions of my dream that I have seen, and the interpretation
thereof.

4:10 Thus were the visions of mine head in my bed; I saw, and behold a
tree in the midst of the earth, and the height thereof was great.

4:11 The tree grew, and was strong, and the height thereof reached
unto heaven, and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth: 4:12
The leaves thereof were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it
was meat for all: the beasts of the field had shadow under it, and the
fowls of the heaven dwelt in the boughs thereof, and all flesh was fed
of it.

Shit breaks down if you have several thousand files.  I really want 
simplicity.  [C:/Doc/RedSea.TXT.Z,1] filesystem has one block per cluster. 
The 
typical person will have around 80 Meg in use.  Small files are what I design 
around.  If you do not have "multimedia" then you never use very much space.  
Think about it.  I have 2 Meg of code after working ten years.  I mostly
don't 
want libraries, just everybody using the core without 3rd party add-ons.

5:24 Now when the high priest and the captain of the temple and the

expertice.  You are a fucken nigger who is just now doing what I did in 1984, 
on my Commodore.  I was writing interrupt routines.

In my CSE523 course, we had a 2 week project to make a task scheduler on a 
Motorola 6800, a little 8-bit CPU.  The task scheduler had to handle one shot 
or periodic tasks.

Is this Ira Seaver?  That mother fucker kept asking the same fucken questions 
doubting my answers.  I am the best programmer on the planet, dip-shit -- 
that's why God chose me.  I wrote a Kernel AND a compiler.  Fuck you.
