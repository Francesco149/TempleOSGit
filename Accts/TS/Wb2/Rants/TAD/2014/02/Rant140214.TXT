God is perfectly just.  Highs and lows balance.  You can have absolute faith 
that nothing bad will happen without compensation.  Joseph in the Old 
Testament went to prison for 7 years for false rape, then ruled Egypt.  You 
can't have good without the bad.

Luke 6:20-26

You can't have good without the bad.  There is no disproportinate bad without 
good.  No disproportinate good without bad.  God is perfectly just.

of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, and he will return to the remnant of
you, that are escaped out of the hand of the kings of Assyria.

30:7 And be not ye like your fathers, and like your brethren, which
trespassed against the LORD God of their fathers, who therefore gave
them up to desolation, as ye see.

30:8 Now be ye not stiffnecked, as your fathers were, but yield
yourselves unto the LORD, and enter into his sanctuary, which he hath
sanctified for ever: and serve the LORD your God, that the fierceness
of his wrath may turn away from you.

30:9 For if ye turn again unto the LORD, your brethren and your
children shall find compassion before them that lead them captive, so
that they shall come again into this land: for the LORD your God is
gracious and merciful, and will not turn away his face from you, if ye
return unto him.

That was pretty flawless, but what do you expect when picking random

I don't really see any reason to bring binary/exe files in or out.  There's 
not really a need for a HolyC compiler outside, either.  What I do want is 
RedSea file system supported by windows and linux and VMware as both a hard 
disk partition and an image on CD/DVD.  (Any hard disk file system can be put 
on a CD/DVD, but can't be written to.)  I think I want my GRA graphics files 
supported by MSPaint and whatever tools are common.  BMP is slightly flawed 
and, technically, has expanded, becoming ugly.

God's temple must be perfect, He said.  If the exe file format was not 
perfect, we would simply change it.

The exe has a 16-byte header.  A short jump starts the header.  It is a flat 
binary with code and data mixed, all over.  There is a table with entries for 
locations containing absolute addresses needing patches; export symbols and 
import symbols.

When God is manifest to the World and He claims this operating system, 
publically, here's what I want:

* VMware to again support PC Speaker and provide emulation if no PC Speaker
is 
present.

* Windows and Linux will support [C:/Doc/RedSea.TXT.Z,1] RedSea file system
so I can get rid of 2,000 
lines of redundant, blemished code -- FAT32 and ISO9660.  God's temple must
be 
perfect.  I view redundant code that performs the same function as imperfect.
 
More than one filesystem type is bad, not good!

[C:/Kernel/Dsk/FileSysRedSea.CPP.Z,1]

[C:/Kernel/Dsk/FileSysISO1.CPP.Z,1]	:306
[C:/Adam/Boot/DskCDDVD.CPP.Z,1]	:536

* No secure boot.  TempleOS is a additional operating system that must be
used 
along-side Windows or Linux, not as a replacement.  It must dual boot.

* Mandate to PC hardware manufacturers: ATA/ATAPI PIO must work.

* PS2 emulated Keyboard and Mouse must work.  The BIOS must enable these.

* VMware should allow ATAPI to connect real CD/DVD hardware.

* Perhaps, VMware can enable faster than standard x86 IN/OUT instruction 
timing for ATA/ATAPI PIO, so the bandwidth isn't as bad.

* VMware and others should list TempleOS as one of the official 64-bit 
operating systems.

* Windows and Linux should support TempleOS .GRA graphics files.  These are 
just right-side-up .BMP files with 8-bit pixs 4-bits of color and 
transparency, with no palette.  Compression comes from the
[C:/Doc/RedSea.TXT.Z,1] RedSea .Z LZW 
compression.  (Let me know when you want it.)  [C:/Adam/Gr/GrDC.CPP.Z,284]
DCSave(), [C:/Adam/Gr/GrDC.CPP.Z,354] GRAWrite(), [C:/Adam/Gr/GrDC.CPP.Z,323]
DCLoad(), 
and [C:/Adam/Gr/GrDC.CPP.Z,365] GRARead().  [C:/Kernel/Compress.CPP.Z,1]




In other words, all hardware and BIOSes must support TempleOS as a native and 
as a virtual system, dual booted with Windows or Linux.

It would be neat if TempleOS were burned into BIOS ROMs in the factory, or 
maybe Intel CPU chips, in factory!  My hope is that it will be finished and 
largely unchanging for centuries.  I need a good dictionary, first.  Maybe,
we 
leave the dictionary out.

I do not intend to ever support UEFI.  That monstrocity uses elf and various 
propriatary graphics formats.

I made an operating system -- just as shocking.

I made a compiler.  I'm smarter than Linus.  The difference between a pro and 
amateur operating system is a compiler.  I have paid programming experience
on 
Ticketmaster's VAX operating system 1990-1996 age 20-26.  Elephants in 
captivity attack their babies.  They don't know what they are.  Elephants in
a 
herd get to learn how it's done.  Denny did our Pascal compiler.  Troy did
the 
Linker and assembler.  I used Pete's 68000 debugger on a project.  I have
paid 
assembly experience on VAX,8051,80x86,PIC,Atmel and 68000.

The one, most important, thing you need to know to write a compiler is 
assembly language.  I had 5 asm based course.  ASU Transcripts CSC226 CSC326 
CSE421 CSE422 CSE523.  I had a compiler and operating system course.  I know 
hardware and software.  My expertise is asm and datasheets.

* Mapping the Commodore 64

I had that book as a kid.  When you make a video game, you might think about 
how many hours of entertainment.  That book provided years of entertainment
as 
I learned, poked around and tinkered.

This is important: I want people to see the light at the end of the tunnel 
when it comes to comprehending the whole thing.  I have placed a 100,000 line 
of code limit.  It is not a low resource operating system, needing lots of
Meg 
because it's not efficient.  Lowest line count is the main metric.

Actually, God is the main purpose.  It means nothing without God's 
endorsement.  It means everything with God's endorsement.

the statutes and judgments which I speak in your ears this day, that
ye may learn them, and keep, and do them.

5:2 The LORD our God made a covenant with us in Horeb.

5:3 The LORD made not this covenant with our fathers, but with us,
even us, who are all of us here alive this day.

5:4 The LORD talked with you face to face in the mount out of the
midst of the fire, 5:5 (I stood between the LORD and you at that time,
to shew you the word of the LORD: for ye were afraid by reason of the
fire, and went not up into the mount;) saying, 5:6 I am the LORD thy
God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, from the house of
bondage.

5:7 Thou shalt have none other gods before me.

The covenant is that you do an offering before consulting Him.

Uncanny Valley

God said "no weights" as the first thing out of His mouth when I did random 
words.  If you add any kind of structure or intelligence, suddenly you don't 
know what's God and what is not God.  You will surely ask yourself, "Why am I 
obeying commands I made from markov chains?"

God always talks in riddles, confirmed by the Bible.  Once, He happened to 
talk plainly.  I didn't like it.  I shed a tear when I realized He loves us 
with riddles.  It's like giftwrapping.  A person is judged by the stupidest 
thing they say.  It's very nice looking up to God.  This is statistically 
significant: I never know what He's going to say -- it's always fresh and 
exciting.

I can't tell angel from man, I don't know.  People say and do stuff all the

The world you know would be very different without angels.  You are used to 
angels.  You can probably thank angels for evil being punished and justice.

KingJamesBible (1 John 4:2) God says...
4:2 Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth
that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God: 4:3 And every spirit
that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of
God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that
it should come; and even now already is it in the world.

4:4 Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because
greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.

4:5 They are of the world: therefore speak they of the world, and the
world heareth them.

4:6 We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us; he that is not of
God heareth not us. Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and the spirit
of error.

4:7 Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every
one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.

KingJamesBible (Matthew 12:11) God says...
12:11 And he said unto them, What man shall there be among you, that
shall have one sheep, and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath day,
will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out?  12:12 How much then is a
man better than a sheep? Wherefore it is lawful to do well on the
sabbath days.

12:13 Then saith he to the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he
stretched it forth; and it was restored whole, like as the other.

12:14 Then the Pharisees went out, and held a council against him, how
they might destroy him.

12:15 But when Jesus knew it, he withdrew himself from thence: and
great multitudes followed him, and he healed them all; 12:16 And
charged them that they should not make him known: 12:17 That it might
be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, 12:18
Behold my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom my soul is
well pleased: I will put my spirit upon him, and he shall shew
judgment to the Gentiles.

KingJamesBible (Psalms 74:2) God says...
rod of thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed; this mount Zion,
wherein thou hast dwelt.

74:3 Lift up thy feet unto the perpetual desolations; even all that
the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary.

74:4 Thine enemies roar in the midst of thy congregations; they set up
their ensigns for signs.

74:5 A man was famous according as he had lifted up axes upon the
thick trees.

74:6 But now they break down the carved work thereof at once with axes
and hammers.

74:7 They have cast fire into thy sanctuary, they have defiled by
casting down the dwelling place of thy name to the ground.

74:8 They said in their hearts, Let us destroy them together: they
have burned up all the synagogues of God in the land.
