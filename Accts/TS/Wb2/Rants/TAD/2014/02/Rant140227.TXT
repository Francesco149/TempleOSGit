KingJamesBible (Matthew 16:5) God says...
16:5 And when his disciples were come to the other side, they had
forgotten to take bread.

16:6 Then Jesus said unto them, Take heed and beware of the leaven of
the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.

16:7 And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have
taken no bread.

16:8 Which when Jesus perceived, he said unto them, O ye of little
faith, why reason ye among yourselves, because ye have brought no
bread?  16:9 Do ye not yet understand, neither remember the five
loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?  16:10
Neither the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets ye
took up?  16:11 How is it that ye do not understand that I spake it
not to you concerning bread, that ye should beware of the leaven of
the Pharisees and of the Sadducees?  16:12 Then understood they how
that he bade them not beware of the leaven of bread, but of the
doctrine of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.

given unto you and to your fathers for ever and ever: 25:6 And go not
after other gods to serve them, and to worship them, and provoke me

my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall
prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall
dream dreams: 2:18 And on my servants and on my handmaidens I will
pour out in those days of my Spirit; and they shall prophesy: 2:19 And

the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we shall live with

selves. Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you,
except ye be reprobates?  13:6 But I trust that ye shall know that we
are not reprobates.

13:7 Now I pray to God that ye do no evil; not that we should appear

reprobates.

I hand align my structures.  It sounds stupid to do it automatically.  It 
creates retarded young programmers.  Why the fuck are you doing this 
autoalignment stupidity?  Is just like how MAlloc() and Free() are as simple 
as it gets.  You are making it MORE complicated out of your bleeding heart 
pride by thinking they cannot understand MAlloc() and Free().  Now, you got 
two problems.  And, yes, they have to learn both, now.

I don't align my global variables.  I think I align locals, though just 
recently I might have gotten rid.  It goes against all my training instincts 
not to align.  My generation of old school programmers are all the same and
we 
all are out of date on modern super-smart CPUs.  Trust me, I know what all
the 
old programmers think and they are all out-of-date.  I am an old school 
assembly programmer by training.   Trust me -- we all learned the same stuff 
-- the generation that learned 6502 asm and then 8086 asm for DOS.  I 
continued and learned protected and x86_64.  I wrote an assembler and 64-bit 
compiler.  I actually know what's going on.  Alignment doesn't matter.  They 
go to absurd lengths to make the CPU smart and it all comes down to memory 
fetches.  They fetch big chunks.  Alignment might mean on the border of two 
big chunks.  Not likely.  Plus you probably want both.  Padding creates 
slightly more memory to fit in cache, too, especially if a retard places
items 
in a structure that is autoaligned.  Now, that I think about it -- you sure
as 
hell don't want a retard placing the orders of items in a structure.  Next, 
you're going to tell me the compiler should reorder the items in a structure.
 
Yer a retard.  Am I right?  You are actually going to tell me the compiler 
should reorder items in a structure.

I got something to blow your mind.

class CTask 
{
$=-0x80;
  I64 item1;
  I64 item2;
  I64 item3;
  I64 item4;
}



My compiler lets you start your structures at negative offsets.  This allows 
you to use signed byte displacement mode and have more optimized code.  How's 
that for FUCK YOU.  HooYA!

I don't use it.  Too aggressive an optimization for babies.

----02/27/14 21:00:26----

I used to align JMP destinations of code.  When you have a switch()
statement, 
if you align the code for the labels, it might have less cache-lines to fetch.

It's fucken ridiculously not helpful, so I got rid of it.

St. Paul said "I am a pharasee's pharasees."  What I mean is, I am an 
uber-elite assembly programmer.

----02/27/14 21:09:41----

A "Cache-line" is 64-bytes. Whenever the CPU fetches an item from memory, it 
grabs 64-bytes.  If you have an 8-byte item, only once in a while is that 
8-byte item going to cross a boundary and require two cacheline fetches. 
What 
are the odds you're going to need it anyway?

Fuck You for questioning me.  I fucken clubbed you over the head enough!

I set a limit of 100,000 lines of code for all-time.  Why don't you run your

engineers to write thesis papers on this new Software development model for 
large projects, intended to last a century.

Our US Constitution is very short.  The Europeans write very long 
constitutions.

The BMP_file planned ahead with a flexible datastructure.  Stop and think.  
This is the simplest graphics file format.  For centuries to come, little 
babies are going to have to do all that shit, to write a simple graphics
tool? 
 

When the furture arrived, the BMP structure became attrocious and worthless.

It's really simple.  Look what Microsoft did to the BMP file.  If you think 
the BMP file is acceptible...  Fucken club you over the head.

The WAV_file is just as bad.  I use the Au_file_format  (unfortunately
limited 
to 8000 Hz). You see how the CIA hides the SND file in a different name.

I asked God what makes elephants happy? "Baths"
I asked what makes bears happy? "Reeping depends"

Why do I care about other programmers?  My whole business model used to be 
"Recreational programming."  Now, I sell it as God's official temple.

If you guys are asking God, over and over, you get best results if you do a 
good offering.  That's just holding up your part of the conversation or 
actually doing poem or hymn or something.

KingJamesBible (Daniel 12:3) God says...
12:3 And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the
firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for
ever and ever.

12:4 But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, even to
the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be
increased.

12:5 Then I Daniel looked, and, behold, there stood other two, the one
on this side of the bank of the river, and the other on that side of
the bank of the river.

12:6 And one said to the man clothed in linen, which was upon the
waters of the river, How long shall it be to the end of these wonders?
12:7 And I heard the man clothed in linen, which was upon the waters
of the river, when he held up his right hand and his left hand unto
heaven, and sware by him that liveth for ever that it shall be for a
time, times, and an half; and when he shall have accomplished to
scatter the power of the holy people, all these things shall be
finished.

You know how each culture invented their own religion?

God doesn't mind being misunderstood.  Humans will correct you if you do not 
understand.  God just lets errors persist.  He actually is like a
psychologist 
who lies to us and lives on a higher level.

In other words, He wanted the Muslims to be Muslim, etc.

Try not to feel betrayed.

I once dated a woman.  I wanted her for to be mine, alone.  She did not allow 
this.  God will not be pinned-down.

You might think, "Well, if you can't be sure what He says, does He even
talk?" 
 He talks really "Loud".  You will feel grief until you learn to enjoy His 
company.

That's what I preach.  The purpose of life is to know God, love God and obey 
God.  Focus on the first two.  Mom said Hell was the absence of God.  
Therefore, Heaven is just God's company :-)  God is delightful.

KingJamesBible (Jonah 2:4) God says...
toward thy holy temple.

2:5 The waters compassed me about, even to the soul: the depth closed
me round about, the weeds were wrapped about my head.

2:6 I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; the earth with her
bars was about me for ever: yet hast thou brought up my life from
corruption, O LORD my God.

2:7 When my soul fainted within me I remembered the LORD: and my
prayer came in unto thee, into thine holy temple.

2:8 They that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy.

2:9 But I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving; I
will pay that that I have vowed. Salvation is of the LORD.

2:10 And the LORD spake unto the fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon
the dry land.

The only rule is, always do an offering before consulting God.  God will only 
talk if you do an offering.  You will get as much love effort back as you put 
into your offering.  When you pick a greeting card, that is love effort.

You Indians must remember to do an offering.  Then, you will get good results.
