the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.

1:23 And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.

1:24 And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after
his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his
kind: and it was so.

1:25 And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle
after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after
his kind: and God saw that it was good.

1:26 And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness:
and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl
of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over
every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.

1:27 So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created
he him; male and female created he them.

Being proud of heart is bad.  Proud of heart means you will not accept a
gift, 
even a gift from God.  God likes Beverly HillBillies.  On the Arab/Jew 
conflict, God said "Oil funny, hopefully."  Judas betrayed Jesus because
Jesus 
allowed expensive perfume to be poured on him.  God loved Jacob and hated 
Esau.  Esau gave-up his birthright.

"Laugh with those who laugh; Cry with those who cry," has some merit, but has 
limits.  I'm not going to take any shit.

KingJamesBible (John 9:39) God says...
9:39 And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they
which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind.

9:40 And some of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words,
and said unto him, Are we blind also?  9:41 Jesus said unto them, If
ye were blind, ye should have no sin: but now ye say, We see;
therefore your sin remaineth.

10:1 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door
into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a
thief and a robber.

10:2 But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.

10:3 To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he
calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out.

10:4 And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them,
and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice.

I asked God when eggs were invented:

4:19 My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ
be formed in you, 4:20 I desire to be present with you now, and to
change my voice; for I stand in doubt of you.

4:21 Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the
law?  4:22 For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, the one by a
bondmaid, the other by a freewoman.

4:23 But he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh; but he
of the freewoman was by promise.

4:24 Which things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants;
the one from the mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage, which is
Agar.

4:25 For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to
Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children.

4:26 But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us
all.

4:27 For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not; break
forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for the desolate hath many
more children than she which hath an husband.

4:28 Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise.

4:29 But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that
was born after the Spirit, even so it is now.

4:30 Nevertheless what saith the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman and
her son: for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son
of the freewoman.

I asked God the biggest thing to fly.  "Couch"

traits.  Some people make money.  They earn it, to some degree, though not 
always, but life finds a way to make it equal.  When you factor in the other 
facets of life, it becomes more plausable that it's just.

The truth is, it's an impossible question to answer for any single person.  
Jesus said "If you laugh, you will weep; if you weep, you will laugh."  
Luke 6:20-26

To some degree, it is useless knowing the world is just because, we all want 
to make the right choice and it mostly comes down to pay now or pay later.  
Half a dozen one way and six the other.  If you're like me, you go insane 
because you want to pick what's in your interest and, pretty-much, it sucks 
because there's no way to pick and get something for nothing.

On the other hand, knowing it is just helps because you might just forget 
about anything where you think you are getting something for nothing.  I'm
not 
sure, but if you use your imagination you might trace how something actually 
is too good to be true.

This stuff is kinda disturbing and heavy, huh.  I'm not sure its good for 
everybody to know it.  I don't know what God wants.

KingJamesBible (1 Peter 1:21) God says...
glory; that your faith and hope might be in God.

1:22 Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through
the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, see that ye love one
another with a pure heart fervently: 1:23 Being born again, not of
corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which
liveth and abideth for ever.

1:24 For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower
of grass. The grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away:
1:25 But the word of the Lord endureth for ever. And this is the word
which by the gospel is preached unto you.

2:1 Wherefore laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies,
and envies, all evil speakings, 2:2 As newborn babes, desire the
sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby: 2:3 If so be ye
have tasted that the Lord is gracious.

2:4 To whom coming, as unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of men,
but chosen of God, and precious, 2:5 Ye also, as lively stones, are

They were feeding a bear.  He seemed like a glutton bear.  Then, I remembered 
they must gain a ton of weight.

You know what's amazing?  A female polar bear can give birth in the winter to 
two cubs in her den and nurse them for, like, two months, all on winter body 
fat!  That boggles my mind, when you look at how big they are.

Jesus said God cares for sparrows.  I watched a polar bear movie and I was 
afraid for the poor mother that she would get food.  Feed her, God!  Make 
sure.  They way they portrayed it, it looked like sooner or later she would 
not have luck and would starve, so it seemed like maybe God really did
provide 
her every meal.

KingJamesBible (Matthew 23:37) God says...
23:37 O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and
stonest them which are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered
thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her
wings, and ye would not!  23:38 Behold, your house is left unto you
desolate.

23:39 For I say unto you, Ye shall not see me henceforth, till ye
shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.

24:1 And Jesus went out, and departed from the temple: and his
disciples came to him for to shew him the buildings of the temple.

24:2 And Jesus said unto them, See ye not all these things? verily I
say unto you, There shall not be left here one stone upon another,
that shall not be thrown down.

24:3 And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came unto
him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what
shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world?  24:4
And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man deceive

If you stop and think about all the wild sparrows, they can't go for more
than 
a couple days without food, probably, how on Earth does their luck not
run-out 
on a dry spell and they all starve?  God really does feed them, like Jesus 
said!  (He got it from Psalm 50.)
