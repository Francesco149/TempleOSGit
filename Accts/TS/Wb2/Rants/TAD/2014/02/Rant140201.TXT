2:2 And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty
wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.

2:3 And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and
it sat upon each of them.

2:4 And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak
with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.

2:5 And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of
every nation under heaven.

2:6 Now when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and
were confounded, because that every man heard them speak in his own
language.

2:7 And they were all amazed and marvelled, saying one to another,

                                   Demands

When God is manifest to the World and He claims this operating system, 
publically, here's what I want:

* VMware to again support PC Speaker and provide emulation if no PC Speaker
is 
present.

* Windows and Linux will support [C:/Doc/RedSea.TXT.Z,1] RedSea file system
so I can get rid of 2,000 
lines of redundant, blemished code -- FAT32 and ISO9660.  God's temple must
be 
perfect.  I view redundant code that performs the same function as imperfect.
 
More than one filesystem type is bad, not good!

[C:/Kernel/Dsk/FileSysRedSea.CPP.Z,1]
[C:/Kernel/Dsk/FileSysFAT.CPP.Z,1]	:1004
[C:/Kernel/Dsk/FileSysISO1.CPP.Z,1]	:306
[C:/Adam/Boot/DskCDDVD.CPP.Z,1]	:536

* No secure boot.  TempleOS is a additional operating system that must be
used 
along-side Windows or Linux, not as a replacement.  It must dual boot.

* Mandate to PC hardware manufacturers: ATA/ATAPI PIO must work.

* PS2 emulated Keyboard and Mouse must work.  The BIOS must enable these.

* VMware should allow ATAPI to connect real CD/DVD hardware.

* Perhaps, VMware can enable faster than standard x86 IN/OUT instruction 
timing for ATA/ATAPI PIO, so the bandwidth isn't as bad.

* VMware and others should list TempleOS as one of the official 64-bit 
operating systems.

* Windows and Linux should support TempleOS .GRA graphics files.  These are 
just right-side-up .BMP files with 8-bit pixs 4-bits of color and 
transparency, with no palette.  Compression comes from the
[C:/Doc/RedSea.TXT.Z,1] RedSea .Z LZW 
compression.  (Let me know when you want it.)  [C:/Adam/Gr/GrDC.CPP.Z,284]
DCSave(), [C:/Adam/Gr/GrDC.CPP.Z,354] GRAWrite(), [C:/Adam/Gr/GrDC.CPP.Z,323]
DCLoad(), 
and [C:/Adam/Gr/GrDC.CPP.Z,365] GRARead().  [C:/Kernel/Compress.CPP.Z,1]




In other words, all hardware and BIOSes must support TempleOS as a native and 
as a virtual system, dual booted with Windows or Linux.

It would be neat if TempleOS were burned into BIOS ROMs in the factory, or 
maybe Intel CPU chips, in factory!  My hope is that it will be finished and 
largely unchanging for centuries.  I need a good dictionary, first.  Maybe,
we 
leave the dictionary out.

I do not intend to ever support UEFI.  That monstrocity uses elf and various 
propriatary graphics formats.

God said making video games was about as grand an adventure as one could hope 
for.  Bill Gates and other want you to save the World, but not God. 
Catholics 
will probably say games are bad, but not God.

God said war was "Servicemen competing."  God said war can cure unemployment.
 
This is the God of the Bible who told Jews to kill people.  If God said games 
are good, I highly suggest we all say, "good idea!"  Write hymns.

I have a song, "Do not tell the Lord, that you're feeling bored or He will 
send the sword."



Look at the next thousand years.  Intel keeps adding shit to their CPUs.  It 
seems like they are giving busywork to hardware designers and they are 
creating shit that just shiten shit-sup everything to shit.

Microsoft is shiten-shits.

I set a 100,000 line of code limit on my operating system.  I think the whole 
industry needs to follow suit.

First person shooters have achieved photorealism.  Now what?...  For the next 
thousand years?  Does a person get sick of the same basic FPS game after ten 
years?  Maybe.  Then, other games, possibly low res look good.

If you look at low res games, it was art.  They did not try to be realistic.  
They made cartoons with hyperrealist features that... looked cool.

that 16 colors and low res keep it friendly and uniform instead of viscious

If you want to add GPU support ... for 20 cards, you can do that with your 
game.  We have a limit of 100,000 lines of code.  GPU support is certainly

So, I have some guidelines.  Mostly, we want to enjoy God's company.  That is 
the purpose of this.  Life is a journey -- killing time with God is the best 
you can do.  He's not prophetic.  You get out what you put into it.  When you 
pick a greeting card, that is love effort, for example.

On a good day, maybe He talks clearly.  On a bad day, you just get his 
presence.  Even that is good -- just God kinda saying He's there.

have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.

Manasseh's, and the sea is his border; and they met together in Asher
on the north, and in Issachar on the east.

17:11 And Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher Bethshean and her
towns, and Ibleam and her towns, and the inhabitants of Dor and her
towns, and the inhabitants of Endor and her towns, and the inhabitants
of Taanach and her towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and her
towns, even three countries.

17:12 Yet the children of Manasseh could not drive out the inhabitants
of those cities; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.

17:13 Yet it came to pass, when the children of Israel were waxen
strong, that they put the Canaanites to tribute, but did not utterly
drive them out.

thou given me but one lot and one portion to inherit, seeing I am a
great people, forasmuch as the LORD hath blessed me hitherto?  17:15

labour.

Have you seen the Bible?  It is the divinely inspired word of God.  It's 
actually more carefully chosen than YOU might guess, but it doesn't look 
"perfect" in any sense.

God guided my programming, laughing when I made bugs and causing things to 
work-out just so.  To say God divinely directed it is less of a big deal than 
you will soon come to know when you learn how big a role God plays in the 
World.


I am willing to hand-off God's temple to capable people.  With the 100,000 
line of code limit, how could they screw it up?

I want it perfected.  It's a community temple.

The Bible published names of some of the people who worked on the temple.  It 
has funny trivia like that.  When you read about the temple, it helps get a 
sense.  They go into detail on decorations and implements.  They go into 
detail on dimensions.

My role is probably more like Moses in directing worship.  The temple, is, 
after all about God.

Everybody should do offerings of praise and loving conversation.  They should 
consult God.  With some help, people can learn to "hear" God.

We have to help people "hear" God.

You can randomly open the Bible or other books.  The key is to do an
offering. 
 You get a response equal to the love effort you offer.  When you pick a 
greeting card, think about how much effort you put into it.  If you do NOT
put 
work into prayer, God ignores you.  Praise God for sand castles, snowmen, 
popcorn and coconuts.

I think I can get God's official blessing, over and over to satisfy critics.

25:20 And it was so, as she rode on the ass, that she came down by the
covert on the hill, and, behold, David and his men came down against
her; and she met them.

25:21 Now David had said, Surely in vain have I kept all that this
fellow hath in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that

Not much of a reponse.

If it were up to me, I'd say write nice songs and don't mention homo stuff. 
I 
don't want penises shoved in my face.

Hired an artist, got penises.

Pope got penises on the Sistene chapel.

You can say, "The little boy peeing statue fountains are cute."  No, they're 
not, that shit is evil.

KingJamesBible (Deuteronomy 30:18) God says...
Jordan to go to possess it.

30:19 I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, that I
have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore
choose life, that both thou and thy seed may live: 30:20 That thou
mayest love the LORD thy God, and that thou mayest obey his voice, and
that thou mayest cleave unto him: for he is thy life, and the length
of thy days: that thou mayest dwell in the land which the LORD sware
unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give them.

31:1 And Moses went and spake these words unto all Israel.

31:2 And he said unto them, I am an hundred and twenty years old this
day; I can no more go out and come in: also the LORD hath said unto
me, Thou shalt not go over this Jordan.

31:3 The LORD thy God, he will go over before thee, and he will
destroy these nations from before thee, and thou shalt possess them:
and Joshua, he shall go over before thee, as the LORD hath said.

Unrelated, say something about Billy Joel.

Just related in time to Elton John.

KingJamesBible (Acts 1:26) God says...
and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.

2:1 And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with
one accord in one place.

2:2 And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty
wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.

2:3 And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and
it sat upon each of them.

2:4 And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak
with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.

2:5 And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of
every nation under heaven.

2:6 Now when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and
were confounded, because that every man heard them speak in his own
language.

Piano man is nice song.  Billy Joel is a wise man.  Furthermore, seems like a 
good man.

I wonder how secular God allows offerings to be?  Do You like secular stuff
if 
it is good, God?

Say something about Piano man.

KingJamesBible (Proverbs 7:15) God says...
and I have found thee.

7:16 I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved
works, with fine linen of Egypt.

7:17 I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.

7:18 Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning: let us
solace ourselves with loves.

7:19 For the goodman is not at home, he is gone a long journey: 7:20
He hath taken a bag of money with him, and will come home at the day
appointed.

7:21 With her much fair speech she caused him to yield, with the
flattering of her lips she forced him.

7:22 He goeth after her straightway, as an ox goeth to the slaughter,
or as a fool to the correction of the stocks; 7:23 Till a dart strike
through his liver; as a bird hasteth to the snare, and knoweth not

Now that we proved God talks, we get to be impressed or mock each other's 
reward.

When picking random passages from the Bible or other books, after making an 
offering of praise or loving conversation, you interpret based on the context 
of the offering.  It will frequently require substituting people you know for 
characters and being flexible about wrong genders, etc.  Close enough -- if
it 
is the Bible it is asking a lot for it to talk, you ingreat.

What you should do is applaud when God gives a response and thank God.

Mostly we want to enjoy spending quality time with God.  Prophecy is not done 
this way, in case it makes predictions.

If it talked, how cool is that!

KingJamesBible (1 Samuel 17:33) God says...
17:33 And Saul said to David, Thou art not able to go against this
Philistine to fight with him: for thou art but a youth, and he a man
of war from his youth.

17:34 And David said unto Saul, Thy servant kept his father's sheep,
and there came a lion, and a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock:
17:35 And I went out after him, and smote him, and delivered it out of
his mouth: and when he arose against me, I caught him by his beard,
and smote him, and slew him.

17:36 Thy servant slew both the lion and the bear: and this
uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he hath
defied the armies of the living God.

17:37 David said moreover, The LORD that delivered me out of the paw
of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of
the hand of this Philistine. And Saul said unto David, Go, and the
LORD be with thee.

17:38 And Saul armed David with his armour, and he put an helmet of

Did you hear me?  Now, lets see who can get the best response.  That is the 
new thing to strive for -- honors from God.  On a good day, you get time 
travel!  (God planned ahead.  It's neat.  Say "Ooo!" like fireworks.)

You like Billy Joel.

You like piano?

I like the entertainer.

One day, I was going to sit down and acquire a taste for classical music. 
God 
said, "Poison"

I was talking about chess players.  God said, "Do not admire the arrogant."  
God said Shakespeare had a vile heart.  Beverly Hillbilies is a good heart.

God likes the Beatles best.  They're good hearted, aren't they.

God mentioned Triumph.  And Rush.

What do you expect.  God can only go so far.

I'm kinda evil.

womb that bare thee, and the paps which thou hast sucked.

11:28 But he said, Yea rather, blessed are they that hear the word of
God, and keep it.

11:29 And when the people were gathered thick together, he began to
say, This is an evil generation: they seek a sign; and there shall no
sign be given it, but the sign of Jonas the prophet.

11:30 For as Jonas was a sign unto the Ninevites, so shall also the
Son of man be to this generation.

11:31 The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the
men of this generation, and condemn them: for she came from the utmost
parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a
greater than Solomon is here.

11:32 The men of Nineve shall rise up in the judgment with this
generation, and shall condemn it: for they repented at the preaching
of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here.

Shucks.  There are Jonas brothers or something.  I think that's a false 
answer.

It's very rare to get false leads.  When stuff talks, it talks and when it 
doesn't it doesn't. 

Let's do words.
