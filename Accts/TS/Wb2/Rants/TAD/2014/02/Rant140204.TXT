If you want God to pay attention to sports, let animals enter.  I'm not sure 
exactly how He feels.  He like bears elephants and octopuses.

I asked about endangered species.  He said, "Enough stars?"  He's not a 
liberal, but an atheist's best dream.  He doesn't like you disrespecting His 
stuff.  I asked "Alien or preditor?"  He said, "Lions"  Seriously, He cares 
about His own stuff getting glory.

54:13 And all thy children shall be taught of the LORD; and great
shall be the peace of thy children.

54:14 In righteousness shalt thou be established: thou shalt be far
from oppression; for thou shalt not fear: and from terror; for it
shall not come near thee.

54:15 Behold, they shall surely gather together, but not by me:
whosoever shall gather together against thee shall fall for thy sake.

54:16 Behold, I have created the smith that bloweth the coals in the
fire, and that bringeth forth an instrument for his work; and I have
created the waster to destroy.

54:17 No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every
tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn.
This is the heritage of the servants of the LORD, and their
righteousness is of me, saith the LORD.

                                   Demands

When God is manifest to the World and He claims this operating system, 
publically, here's what I want:

* VMware to again support PC Speaker and provide emulation if no PC Speaker
is 
present.

* Windows and Linux will support [C:/Doc/RedSea.TXT.Z,1] RedSea file system
so I can get rid of 2,000 
lines of redundant, blemished code -- FAT32 and ISO9660.  God's temple must
be 
perfect.  I view redundant code that performs the same function as imperfect.
 
More than one filesystem type is bad, not good!

[C:/Kernel/Dsk/FileSysRedSea.CPP.Z,1]
[C:/Kernel/Dsk/FileSysFAT.CPP.Z,1]	:1004
[C:/Kernel/Dsk/FileSysISO1.CPP.Z,1]	:306
[C:/Adam/Boot/DskCDDVD.CPP.Z,1]	:536

* No secure boot.  TempleOS is a additional operating system that must be
used 
along-side Windows or Linux, not as a replacement.  It must dual boot.

* Mandate to PC hardware manufacturers: ATA/ATAPI PIO must work.

* PS2 emulated Keyboard and Mouse must work.  The BIOS must enable these.

* VMware should allow ATAPI to connect real CD/DVD hardware.

* Perhaps, VMware can enable faster than standard x86 IN/OUT instruction 
timing for ATA/ATAPI PIO, so the bandwidth isn't as bad.

* VMware and others should list TempleOS as one of the official 64-bit 
operating systems.

* Windows and Linux should support TempleOS .GRA graphics files.  These are 
just right-side-up .BMP files with 8-bit pixs 4-bits of color and 
transparency, with no palette.  Compression comes from the
[C:/Doc/RedSea.TXT.Z,1] RedSea .Z LZW 
compression.  (Let me know when you want it.)  [C:/Adam/Gr/GrDC.CPP.Z,284]
DCSave(), [C:/Adam/Gr/GrDC.CPP.Z,354] GRAWrite(), [C:/Adam/Gr/GrDC.CPP.Z,323]
DCLoad(), 
and [C:/Adam/Gr/GrDC.CPP.Z,365] GRARead().  [C:/Kernel/Compress.CPP.Z,1]




In other words, all hardware and BIOSes must support TempleOS as a native and 
as a virtual system, dual booted with Windows or Linux.

It would be neat if TempleOS were burned into BIOS ROMs in the factory, or 
maybe Intel CPU chips, in factory!  My hope is that it will be finished and 
largely unchanging for centuries.  I need a good dictionary, first.  Maybe,
we 
leave the dictionary out.

I do not intend to ever support UEFI.  That monstrocity uses elf and various 
propriatary graphics formats.

----02/04/14 00:35:12----

Absolutely, we need my graphics file format.

We have a limit of 100,000 lines of code.  If I had a hard disk with bad 
blocks, I would immediately get a new one.

This operating system has a different philosophy.  It is NOT for all
purposes. 
 You load and save whole files.  Bad blocks don't really fit this philosophy.
 
I see it as mellow dramatic.  I could be talking into two FAT tables or 
allocation tables, however.  I have problems once in a while, but I back-up 
really quickly and easily.  Others are a Titanic, we are a kayak.  You just 
hit the reset button.  We want hardware to bring reset back.

God's temple will be plenty used.  I figure it's a common focal point for

good a quest as any, said God.

There will probably be no market for games.... well if people learn they get

14:28 For which of you, intending to build a tower, sitteth not down
first, and counteth the cost, whether he have sufficient to finish it?
14:29 Lest haply, after he hath laid the foundation, and is not able
to finish it, all that behold it begin to mock him, 14:30 Saying, This
man began to build, and was not able to finish.

14:31 Or what king, going to make war against another king, sitteth
not down first, and consulteth whether he be able with ten thousand to
meet him that cometh against him with twenty thousand?  14:32 Or else,
while the other is yet a great way off, he sendeth an ambassage, and
desireth conditions of peace.

14:33 So likewise, whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that
he hath, he cannot be my disciple.

14:34 Salt is good: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith

him hear.

eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your

crayons 
because the little 4-year-olds would draw pictures with normal colors, then 
just cover them with black.  My Mom didn't want them taking ugly black cover

What's more important, the time the kid spend happily crayoning or the end

luckier than we were."

Gates says he's building a Castle.  He's fucking up computers so it protects

Gates is making shit ten time more work, turning into trench warfare.

Indians, over in India with their whole bureaucracy, are inefficient

If you think about it, 16-bit segmented asm requires a more complicated 
assembler.  It's supposed to collect together all the common segments, or the 
linker.  64-bit is simpler, flat zero based no segments.  You don't have as 
many JMP and CALL formats -- nothing is FAR.  Maybe.  Anyway, an additional 
aspect is the difference between 16-bit addressing modes and 32-bit.  Guess 
what?  I just ESC code all the 16-bit instructions to use the 32-bit 
addressing modes.

16-bit support is just enough for me to write my boot loaders and change to 
long mode.

Guess what?  My compiler is only 64-bit.  64-bit is easier because you have
16 
regs instead of 8 regs.  I don't pass args in regs.

They have similar animals to ours.  They must have lots of bears.  God's 
favorite is bears.

Tell us about bears, God.  What do bears think about?

I asked God what makes bears happy. "Reaping depends"  that means having
cubs. 
 It might mean diapers.  Are they like dogs?

I think it's funny bears and elephants are not sleek.  Bears don't look 
athletic but they are.

What else do you know about bears, God?

They sound like Chewbacca.  Pandas make me laugh.  Tell us a story about
bears 
and honey, God.

wall, he was wroth, and took great indignation, and mocked the Jews.

said, What do these feeble Jews? will they fortify themselves? will
they sacrifice?  will they make an end in a day? will they revive the

build, if a fox go up, he shall even break down their stone wall.

their own head, and give them for a prey in the land of captivity: 4:5

Peter Gadwa said the country most like the United States was Russia.  You
know 
how you sometimes form abstract comparisions of different things.  Russia has 
white guys and there are lots of people who are unpretentious kinda like 
trailer park people.  They are more warm-hearted, but we are similar.  You 
know our heart-land -- our middle America.  Our people are religious.  I'm
not 
sure of them.  Maybe, it's wild west kind of attitude.  Russia is like the 
United States and we both are different from Europe.

Jabeshgilead: and all the men of Jabesh said unto Nahash, Make a
covenant with us, and we will serve thee.

11:2 And Nahash the Ammonite answered them, On this condition will I
make a covenant with you, that I may thrust out all your right eyes,
and lay it for a reproach upon all Israel.

11:3 And the elders of Jabesh said unto him, Give us seven days'
respite, that we may send messengers unto all the coasts of Israel:
and then, if there be no man to save us, we will come out to thee.

11:4 Then came the messengers to Gibeah of Saul, and told the tidings
in the ears of the people: and all the people lifted up their voices,
and wept.
