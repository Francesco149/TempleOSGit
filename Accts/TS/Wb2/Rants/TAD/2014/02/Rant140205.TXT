The Pope talked.  He said he was suspicious of charity which cost nothing.

Basically, highs and lows balance.  Luke 6:20-26  If you laugh now, you will 
cry; if you cry, you will laugh.  So, yes, a sacrifice must hurt.

There is justice.  You will serve as much as you are served.

I think the washing of the feet is important.  St. Peter refused Jesus to was 
his feet, but Jesus insisted.  You might think you are never to have good, 
just bad.  You might never let someone serve you because you don't want to 
serve.

Perhaps, pleasures and pains balance, but you are not to stop living.

Amalekites. And Agag came unto him delicately. And Agag said, Surely
the bitterness of death is past.

15:33 And Samuel said, As the sword hath made women childless, so
shall thy mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed Agag in
pieces before the LORD in Gilgal.

15:34 Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to
Gibeah of Saul.

15:35 And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death:
nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul: and the LORD repented that he
had made Saul king over Israel.

16:1 And the LORD said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul,
seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? fill thine horn
with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Bethlehemite: for I
have provided me a king among his sons.

We should ask God about dinosaurs.  I asked about when eggs were invented.

4:23 But he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh; but he
of the freewoman was by promise.

4:24 Which things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants;
the one from the mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage, which is
Agar.

4:25 For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to
Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children.

4:26 But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us
all.

4:27 For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not; break
forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for the desolate hath many
more children than she which hath an husband.

4:28 Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise.

4:29 But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that
was born after the Spirit, even so it is now.

4:30 Nevertheless what saith the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman and
her son: for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son
of the freewoman.

4:31 So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of
the free.

With eggs a woman is not in bondage and can have many more children.

In 1999, I hit a guy with my car.  I know I hit his knee.  He slammed into my 
windshield, probably breaking collar bone.

In 2003, I ran and jump-kicked a wall, fell and destroyed my knee.

Hey, God!  What did dinosaurs sound like?  Come-on, tell-us!

Please?

How come elephants don't have a logical noise?  Elephants have really deep 
voices when young, then that strange trumpet when old.  Maybe, big animals 
simply can't have voices.  Whales don't have deep voices.

KingJamesBible (Lamentations 2:18) God says...
let not the apple of thine eye cease.

2:19 Arise, cry out in the night: in the beginning of the watches pour
out thine heart like water before the face of the LORD: lift up thy
hands toward him for the life of thy young children, that faint for
hunger in the top of every street.

2:20 Behold, O LORD, and consider to whom thou hast done this. Shall
the women eat their fruit, and children of a span long? shall the
priest and the prophet be slain in the sanctuary of the Lord?  2:21
The young and the old lie on the ground in the streets: my virgins and
my young men are fallen by the sword; thou hast slain them in the day
of thine anger; thou hast killed, and not pitied.

2:22 Thou hast called as in a solemn day my terrors round about, so
that in the day of the LORD's anger none escaped nor remained: those
that I have swaddled and brought up hath mine enemy consumed.

3:1 I AM the man that hath seen affliction by the rod of his wrath.

You parted the sea, right God?  Some of the Bible stories are a little... 
misleading.  The Bible is delightful.

The atheist evolution obsessed people desperately want to be smart.  A
Chinese 
woman fed her kids cow brains.  The atheist want to read books to make them 
smart.  They should seek wisdom by reading the Bible over and over.  You get 
wisdom by rereading -- gleaning.  That is a hard lesson for them because they 
want to read many high-brow books in a desperate attempt, like the Chinese 
woman.  It's kinda pathetic.

Spirit.

3:22 And the scribes which came down from Jerusalem said, He hath
Beelzebub, and by the prince of the devils casteth he out devils.

3:23 And he called them unto him, and said unto them in parables, How
can Satan cast out Satan?  3:24 And if a kingdom be divided against
itself, that kingdom cannot stand.

3:25 And if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot
stand.

3:26 And if Satan rise up against himself, and be divided, he cannot
stand, but hath an end.

3:27 No man can enter into a strong man's house, and spoil his goods,
except he will first bind the strong man; and then he will spoil his
house.

3:28 Verily I say unto you, All sins shall be forgiven unto the sons
of men, and blasphemies wherewith soever they shall blaspheme: 3:29
But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost hath never
forgiveness, but is in danger of eternal damnation.
