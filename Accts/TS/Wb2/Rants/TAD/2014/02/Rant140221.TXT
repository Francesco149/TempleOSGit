KingJamesBible (Job 5:23) God says...
5:23 For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field: and the
beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee.

5:24 And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle shall be in peace; and
thou shalt visit thy habitation, and shalt not sin.

5:25 Thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great, and thine
offspring as the grass of the earth.

5:26 Thou shalt come to thy grave in a full age, like as a shock of
corn cometh in in his season.

5:27 Lo this, we have searched it, so it is; hear it, and know thou it
for thy good.

weighed, and my calamity laid in the balances together!  6:3 For now
it would be heavier than the sand of the sea: therefore my words are

                                   TempleOS

In 1990 at age 20, I was hired to work on Ticketmaster's VAX operating system 
in VAX assembly language while going to school.  I was basically, an intern, 
but we weren't called that.  I worked there 1990-1996.  Here are my 
ASU Transcripts.

In about 1993, I got a 486 and was eager to try 32-bit mode, so I wrote a DOS 
program in TASM that changed to protected mode and never returned to DOS.  
Ticketmaster's OS was "VAXTMOS", so I called mine "Terry's Protected Mode OS, 
TPMOS".  I had 0xB8000 text mode working, and echoed keyboard to screen.  I 
had simple multitasking and barely a MALLOC.  I set it asside.

In 2003, I resurrected TPMOS and installed FreeDOS to launch it.  I used 
Visual Studio to edit my files when doing lots of editing, then booted 
FreeDOS, used TASM to compile and test it.  Back in those days, FreeDOS ran
in 
real mode.  Today's FreeDOS is not real mode, it emulates with V8086 mode.  
DOSBox is not real mode either.

I had started a company H.A.R.E., so I renamed TPMOS to HOPPY.

I named it Doors, DAVOS, J, LoseThos, SparrowOS and, finally, TempleOS.

east to Janohah; 16:7 And it went down from Janohah to Ataroth, and to
Naarath, and came to Jericho, and went out at Jordan.

16:8 The border went out from Tappuah westward unto the river Kanah;
and the goings out thereof were at the sea. This is the inheritance of
the tribe of the children of Ephraim by their families.

villages.

All I have to do in court, is get the Arizona State University course catalog

assembly programming.  We programmed a PIT and a PIC.  We did a B800 window 
manager.  We got tested on the modes of the PIC in different configurations
-- 
learned about cascading them, so we could make our own hardware designs.  We 
strobbed 7-segment displays and scanned keypad grids.  We did interrupts of 
course.  Then, I took CSC421,422,523 and we did more assembly programming on
a 
M6800 chip. I am an expert in assembly programming.  I can prove that I have 
been paid by three companies to program in assembly language on bare metal.   
I did VAX asm, 8086 asm, 68000 asm and 8051 asm at Ticketmaster in the 6
years 
I was there.   (I did a little 8051 asm during the 2 years at Xytec and
worked 
in C with linux and Sun.)  At Graphic Technologies in the year and a half I 
was there, I programmed in MicroChip's PIC asm and Atmel Avr Tiny12 asm, and

* noreg or reg can be placed before a function local var name.  You can, 
optionally, specify a reg after the reg keyword.

* interrupt, haserrcode, public, argpop or noargpop are function flags. See 
[C:/Demo/Lectures/PageTableEntries2.CPP.Z,1].

* A nounusedwarn statement will suppress an unused var warning.

* You can have multiple member vars of a class named "pad" or "reserved", and 
it won't issue warnings. 

* Type casting is postfix.  To typecast int or F64, use
[C:/Kernel/Adam1b.HPP.Z,197] ToI64(), [C:/Kernel/Adam1b.HPP.Z,199] ToBool()
or 
[C:/Kernel/Adam1b.HPP.Z,198] ToF64(). (TempleOS follows normal C float<-->int
conversion, but sometimes you 
want to override.  These functions are better than multiplying by "1.0" to 
convert to float.) 

* A single quote can encompass multiple characters.  'ABC' is equal to 0x43424
1.  [C:/Kernel/Display.CPP.Z,199] PutChars() takes multiple characters.

* The "`" operator raises a base to a power.

* There is no question-colon operator.

* TempleOS [C:/Compiler/CmpInit.CPP.Z,1] operator precedence

* You can use [C:/Compiler/ICLCC.CPP.Z,6] OptOn([C:/Kernel/Adam1a.HPP.Z,1469]
OPTf_WARN_PAREN) to find unnecessary parentheses in code.

* You can use [C:/Compiler/ICLCC.CPP.Z,6] OptOn([C:/Kernel/Adam1a.HPP.Z,1470]
OPTf_WARN_DUP_TYPES) to find dup local var type 
statements.

* With the #exe{} feature in your src code, you can place programs that
insert 
text into the stream of code being compiled.  See [C:/Kernel/KEnd.CPP.Z,1]
#exe {} for an example where 
the date/time and compile-time prompting for cfguration data is placed into a 
program.  [C:/Compiler/CmpMain.CPP.Z,1] StreamPrint() places text into a src
program stream following the 
conclusion of the #exe{} blk.

* No #define functions exist (I'm not a fan)

* No typedef, use class.

* No type-checking

* Can't use <> with #include, use "".

* "$" is an escape character.  Two dollar signs signify an ordinary $.  See 
[C:/Doc/Dollar.TXT.Z,1].  In asm or [C:/Doc/HolyC.TXT.Z,1] HolyC code, it
also refers to the instruction's 
addr. 

* union is more like a class, so you don't reference it with a union label 
after you define it.  Some common unions are declared in
[C:/Kernel/Adam1a.HPP.Z,12] Adam1a.HPP for 1,2,4 
and 8 byte objects.  If you place a type in front of a union declaration,
that 
is the type when used by itself.  See [C:/Demo/SubIntAccess.CPP.Z,1]. 

* class member vars can have meta data. fmtstr and fmtdata are two meta data 
types now used.  All compiler structures are saved and you can access the 
compiler's info about classes and vars.  See [C:/Demo/ClassMeta.CPP.Z,1] and  
[C:/Adam/Doc/DocPopUp.CPP.Z,301] DocFormDo().

* There is a keyword lastclass you use as a dft arg.  It is set to the class 
name of the previous arg.  See [C:/Adam/Dbg2a.CPP.Z,134] ClassRep().

* See [C:/Demo/Exceptions.CPP.Z,1].  try{} catch{} and throw are different
from C++. 
throw is a function with a char arg.  The char string passed in throw() can
be 
accessed from within a catch{} using the Fs->except_ch.  Within a catch {} 
blk, set the var Fs->catch_except to TRUE if you want to terminate the search 
for a handler.  Use [C:/Kernel/Except.CPP.Z,46] PutExcept() as a handler, if
you like.

* A function is available similar to sizeof which provides the offset of a 
member of a class.  It's called offset.  You place the class name and member 
inside as in offset(classname.membername).  It has nothing to do with 16-bit 
code.  Both sizeof and offset only accept one level of member vars.  That is, 
you can't do sizeof(classname.membername.submembername).

* There is no continue statement.  Use goto.

* No bit field support, but there are bit access [Bit,1] library routines.

* lock{} can be used to apply asm LOCK prefixes to code for safe multicore 
read-modify-write accesses.  The code bracked with have LOCK asm prefix's 
applied to relevant instructions within.  It's a little shoddy.  See 
[C:/Demo/MultiCore/Lock.CPP.Z,1].

* There is a function called [C:/Kernel/Mem1b.CPP.Z,371] MSize() which gives
the size of an object 
allocated off the heap.  For larger size allocations, the system rounds-up to 
a power of two, so MSize() lets you know the real size and you can take full 
advantage of it.

* You can [C:/Kernel/Mem1b.CPP.Z,370] Free() a NULL ptr.  Useful variants of
[C:/Kernel/Mem1b.CPP.Z,376] MAlloc() can be found [C:/Kernel/Mem1b.CPP.Z,383]
Here.  
Each task has a heap and you can MAlloc and Free off of other task's heaps,
or 
make an independent heap with [C:/Kernel/Mem1c.CPP.Z,42] HeapCtrlBPInit().

* The stk does not grow because virtual mem is not used.  I recommend 
allocating large local vars from the heap.  You can change
[C:/Kernel/Adam1a.HPP.Z,2584] DFT_STK and 
recompile Kernel or request more when doing a [C:/Kernel/Task1a.CPP.Z,225]
Spawn().  You can use 
[C:/Kernel/Task1a.CPP.Z,89] CallStkGrow(), but it's odd.  See
[C:/Demo/StkGrow.CPP.Z,1]. 

* Only one base class is allowed.

* All values are extended to 64-bit when accessed.  Intermediate calculations 
are done with 64-bit values.

  The follow examples should be inserted in a function, so that reg variables 
are used.  (Global vars are never reg.)

I16 i;
I32 j;
j=i=0x12345678; //Resulting i is 0x5678 but j is 0x12345678

I64 i=0x8000000000000000;
Print("%X\n",i>>1);  //Result is 0xC000000000000000 as expected

U64 u=0x8000000000000000;
Print("%X\n",u>>1);  //Result is 0x4000000000000000 as expected

I32 i= 0x80000000;   //const is loaded into a 64-bit reg var.
Print("%X\n",i>>1);  //Result is 0x40000000

I32 i=-0x80000000;
Print("%X\n",i>>1);  //Result is 0xC0000000 as expected

[C:/Kernel/StrPrint.CPP.Z,954] MPrint() is like
[C:/Kernel/StrPrint.CPP.Z,932] SPrint() but it returns a
[C:/Kernel/Mem1b.CPP.Z,376] MAllocated str.  It is vary handy 
because you don't have to worry about overflow.

[C:/Kernel/SrvCmd.CPP.Z,491] Auto(U8 *fmt,...) sends text to the current
task's input buffer.
[C:/Kernel/SrvCmd.CPP.Z,472] AutoStr(U8 *fmt,...) sends text of an
[C:/Doc/Glossary.TXT.Z,1] AutoFile to the keyboard stream of the 
current TASK but can also do mouse cmds.

[C:/Kernel/SrvCmd.CPP.Z,451] XTalk(CTask *task,U8 *fmt,...) and text to
another task's input buffer.
[C:/Kernel/SrvCmd.CPP.Z,501] XTalkStr(CTask *task,U8 *fmt,...) sends text of
an [C:/Doc/Glossary.TXT.Z,1] AutoFile to the keyboard 
stream of another TASK but can also do mouse cmds.

[C:/Adam/Doc/DocPlain.CPP.Z,679] DocPrint(CDoc *doc,U8 *fmt,...) sends text
to a document.  You can buffer to a 
Doc and save it, providing the functionality of fprintf.  See 
[C:/Demo/Dsk/FPrintF.CPP.Z,1].

[C:/Kernel/SrvCmd.CPP.Z,404] Adam(U8 *fmt,...) sends text to the adam task to
be compiled and run.
[C:/Kernel/SrvCmd.CPP.Z,425] AdamLog(U8 *fmt,...) and
[C:/Kernel/SrvCmd.CPP.Z,437] AdamErr(U8 *fmt,...) send text to the adam task
to be 
displayed.

[C:/Compiler/CmpMain.CPP.Z,1] StreamPrint(U8 *fmt,...) sends text to the
stream of code being compiled and 
must reside in a #exe{} blk.

[C:/Adam/Gr/GrBitMap.CPP.Z,866] GrPrint(CDC *dc,I64 x,I64 y,U8 *fmt,...) and
[C:/Adam/Gr/GrBitMap.CPP.Z,875] GrVPrint() plots text in graphics 
mode.

[C:/Compiler/CmpMain.CPP.Z,640] ExePrint(U8 *fmt,...) compiles and execute a
string.  Note: It returns the 
result of the last executed expression.

[C:/Adam/AutoFile2a.CPP.Z,28] AFPrint(I64 mS,U8 *fmt)
[C:/Kernel/Display.CPP.Z,199] PutChars()s one at a time with a delay.

[C:/Kernel/Dbg1a.CPP.Z,222] RawPrint(I64 mS,U8 *fmt) sends direct to screen
memory, bypassing window 
manager.

**Note:** Use Print("%s",src) if you need an unmodified string.


The [C:/Kernel/StrPrint.CPP.Z,946] Print() family supports extended format
codes.  See [C:/Kernel/StrPrint.CPP.Z,247] SPrintJoin().
  %[-][0][width][.decimals][flags][hsub_fmt][main_fmt]

flags:
    * 't' is a flag which will truncate to field width.
* ',' is a flag which will add commas every three digits in a %d, %f, %g, 
%e and %n entries.
* '$' is a flag which affects the %Q entry, converting '$' to "\044".
* '/' is a flag which affects the %Q and %q entries, converting '%' to "%%
".
  
sub_fmt:
    For "%n", "%d" or "%u", the sub_fmt causes thousands mode.  "%h?n" will 
pick a var exponent multiples of three unit, while "%h-3n" will display 
milli units or "%h6n" will display mega units.  The 'k' flag is always on 
for "%n".  See [C:/Demo/Print.CPP.Z,1].
  
*  "%n" will print a floating point in engineering notation, exponents being 
multiples of three.  If it has a sub_fmt code, it will display scientific 
units letters.

* "%S" will print a Define entry.

* "%C" will print a ToUpper character.

* "%F" will print a text file.

* "%p" will display ptr.

* "%P" will display link to ptr.

* "%T" and "%D" will display a date or time if you pass a
  [C:/Kernel/Adam1a.HPP.Z,202] CDate.

* "%z" will display a subentry of an enumerated list of text entries.  It 
calls [C:/Kernel/Str1a.CPP.Z,385] LstSub().  Pass subentry first, list second.

* "%Z" will display a Define subentry.  Pass subentry first, lst_define 
second.

* "%Q" will convert "\" to "\\" and quote to backslash quote. (For use in 
creating strs in strs.)

* "%q" will reverse a "%Q".

KingJamesBible (Genesis 15:4) God says...
15:4 And, behold, the word of the LORD came unto him, saying, This
shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own
bowels shall be thine heir.

15:5 And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward
heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he
said unto him, So shall thy seed be.

15:6 And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for
righteousness.

15:7 And he said unto him, I am the LORD that brought thee out of Ur
of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it.

15:8 And he said, LORD God, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit
it?  15:9 And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old,
and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a
turtledove, and a young pigeon.

                             The Purpose of Life

The purpose of life is to know, love and obey God.  Christianity is loving 
neighbor, not God -- secular humanism.  Jesus said loving God is more 
important than loving neighbor.  [C:/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,76908] Matthew,22:36 
He did not say with half your 
brain behind your back.

You don't know God.  [C:/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,34961] 1 Chronicles,28:9,
[C:/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,76908] Matthew,11:27, [C:/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,81941]
Luke,13:25, 
[C:/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,23902] 1 Samuel,3:7  You must talk with God to know Him.
 [C:/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,76908] Matthew,6:6  Seek Him by 
taking the initiative.  [C:/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,81941] Luke,11:9,
[C:/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,57332] Isaiah,30:2

There's something obviously different about people in the Bible compared to 
people today -- God talked!  Did they hear voices?  Maybe.  More likely, they 
used occult techniques such as an oracle.  [C:/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,29345] 1
Kings,6:20  Have you heard of 
"tongues?"  [C:/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,92110] 1 Corinthians,14:1  The idea is, you
let yourself be puppeted by a 
spirit, so you say things.  You try to get a spirit -- the Holy Spirit -- to 
talk.  You might as well use a Ouija board.  However, it turns-out that a 
Ouija board is bad for technical reasons.  A really good technique is just 
randomly opening a book.  God said it is a covenant that you hold-up your end 
of the conversation.  

You can't tell if He's talking unless you have a context of conversation,
but, 
more importantly, you are commanded to do an offering of love, like communion 
preparation.  When you pick a greeting card for someone, that is love effort.
 
If you expect God to put effort toward you, you put effort toward Him.  God 
said, "honest measures" applies between your offering of love and His 
response, like a fair barter.  You get out of prayer what you put into it.  
God wants praise, hymns, or whatever you think He might want.  Try and see, 
like Cain and Abel.  [C:/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,297] Genesis,4:1,
[C:/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,94514] Ephesians,5:10  God told Cain his offering 
was not good and told him to try again.  Cain really loved God!  Can you 
imagine being so heart-broken?

Do a text search for "new song" in the Bible.  It's mentioned nine times.  I 
did hymns
`#include "::/Apps/MusicOrgan/Load";JukeBox("::/Apps/MusicOrgan/Examples");`
.  I did Moses comics
`Dir("::/Apps/AfterEgypt/Comics");View;
`
.  Count the ways you love God.  I praised God 
for sand castles, popcorn, snowmen, bubbles...  You try putting effort into 
praise!  [C:/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,76908] Matthew,11:25,
[C:/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,76908] Matthew,6:29

This is funny -- [C:/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,87803] Acts,2:1 -- they didn't bother
to record anything the Holy 
Spirit said.  The Holy Spirit is supposed to be a really good gift.  
[C:/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,81941] Luke,11:13  Just remember, "Boys are made of
snakes and snails and puppy-dog 
tails."

The technique I use to consult the Holy Spirit is reading a microsecond-range 
stop-watch each button press for random numbers.  Then, I pick words or 
passages.  You can use the AfterEgypt
`#include "::/Apps/AfterEgypt/Run"`
 in God's official temple, TempleOS.

Since seeking the word of the Holy Spirit, I have come to know God much
better 
than I've heard others explain.  God said, for example, that war was, 
"servicemen competing."  That sounds more like the immutable God of our
planet 
than what you hear from most religious people.  God is not Venus (god of
love) 
and not Mars (god of war), He's our dearly beloved God of Earth.  If Mammon
is 
a false god of money, Mars or Venus might be useful words to describe other 
false gods.  I figure the greatest challenge for the Creator is boredom, ours 
and His.  What would teen-age male video games be like if war had never 
happened?  Christ said live by the sword, die by the sword, which is loving 
neighbor as self.  [C:/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,76908] Matthew,26:52

I asked God if the World was perfectly just.  God asked if I was calling Him 
lazy.  I think highs and lows balance.  [C:/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,81941] Luke,6:20
 I don't think God likes 
complaining.  [C:/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,12005] Numbers,11:1  Food and clothing is
all we're to ask for or 
demand, in fact -- daily bread.  [C:/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,95772] 1 Timothy,6:8 
Just think about man in the 
last 100,000 years mostly living like Native Americans and how God must see 
us.  You need food, clothing and entertainment, money is to get those.  Man 
does not live on bread alone.  [C:/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,81941] Luke,4:4,
[C:/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,74130] Amos,8:11

God's favorite animals are bears and elephants.  They are funny shaped -- I 
think God must have seen too much starvation over the years.

God's ways are far above man's ways.  Mom said Heaven was a never-ending 
family reunion.  Yikes!  A friend said, "Most guy's idea of Heaven would be 
running around doing things they'd get locked up for on Earth."  Most people 
are like King Midas.  When you realize how silly most notions of Heaven are, 
you come to appreciate that Earth is not that bad.  This is the first step in 
loving God, the Creator -- praising Creation.  My parents spend their retired 
days watching TV and going to casinos.  That's not a good argument for
getting 
extended-play!

Imagine a billionare.  Everyone around him can't forget his money for even a 
moment.  The truth is, most people are after God's "money" -- they fear for 
their salvation.  Here's a test -- would you pray to and praise God even if 
there were no salvation?  Love God and don't be a "user".  Asking for stuff
is 
annoying.  [C:/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,81941] Luke,11:5 

All those sophisticated theological "infinity" things -- omniscience, 
omnipotence, omnipresence, omnivorous -- will mess you up.  Trust me that 
anthropomorphic is far better, in practice.  Christ suggested thinking of God 
as "Abba" which is Aramaic for "Daddy" and said the childlike had an 
advantage.  [C:/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,76908] Matthew,11:25  Pray out-loud because
God doesn't want the hastle 
of reading your brain.  The best way to stop people from testing God is to 
suggest He can't do everything.

Just as ego causes most to love neighbor, not God, people skip knowing and 
loving God and cowardly get stuck on obeying Him.  This hardly needs 
encouragement.

God does not want pawns to push around.  God will talk, but won't tell you 
what to do, even if you want Him to.  You'll quickly learn that prophecy does 
not come true and should smack yourself for wanting more than just enjoying 
God's company.
