Conjecture vs Hypothesis

When I say that God said stuff, it's odd because He's almost never very
clear, 
yet He knows what we are going to think, so it's not the same as wrongly 
stretching the truth.

He said sports and pets were "homo".  I don't really think He wants that 
proclaimed.  I think He wants the World to run without so much interference.

KingJamesBible (Psalms 55:7) God says...
Selah.

55:8 I would hasten my escape from the windy storm and tempest.

55:9 Destroy, O Lord, and divide their tongues: for I have seen
violence and strife in the city.

55:10 Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof: mischief
also and sorrow are in the midst of it.

55:11 Wickedness is in the midst thereof: deceit and guile depart not
from her streets.

55:12 For it was not an enemy that reproached me; then I could have
borne it: neither was it he that hated me that did magnify himself
against me; then I would have hid myself from him:

55:13 But it was thou, a man mine equal, my guide, and mine
acquaintance.

Technically, there are different categories -- things God might have said, 
things God definitely said, and things God doesn't want known.  LOL  I think
a 
lot falls in the category of things He doesn't want known.  If you call it a 
secret, that's not quite the same.  He says stuff in confidence, though, 
sometimes you don't know what's in confidence or not.

If you love God, in theory you will keep His secrets instead of being a 
show-off.  I'm not very good.

A classic newbie sort of question might be on abortion.  I think He's happy 
with the status quo and doesn't want to change things.  It's bad being a 
busybody.  Ideally, we should love God and think about what makes Him happy.  
He likes praise, for one thing.  I think it's good to be fresh, in the sense 
of original.

On reddit, they have a category called, "Earth porn."  that sounds like the 
best thing, ever.  I think God said in the extreme it becomes not good.

7:12 But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother hath a wife
that believeth not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not
put her away.

7:13 And the woman which hath an husband that believeth not, and if he
be pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him.

7:14 For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the
unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your children
unclean; but now are they holy.

7:15 But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother or a
sister is not under bondage in such cases: but God hath called us to
peace.

husband?  or how knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt save thy
wife?  7:17 But as God hath distributed to every man, as the Lord hath

not my son, which I did bear.

dead is thy son. And this said, No; but the dead is thy son, and the
living is my son. Thus they spake before the king.

and thy son is the dead: and the other saith, Nay; but thy son is the
dead, and my son is the living.

hills moved and were shaken, because he was wroth.

the priests and the prophets and all the people took him, saying, Thou
shalt surely die.

house shall be like Shiloh, and this city shall be desolate without an
inhabitant?  And all the people were gathered against Jeremiah in the

saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against thee, O Gog, the chief prince
of Meshech and Tubal: 39:2 And I will turn thee back, and leave but
the sixth part of thee, and will cause thee to come up from the north
parts, and will bring thee upon the mountains of Israel: 39:3 And I
will smite thy bow out of thy left hand, and will cause thine arrows
to fall out of thy right hand.

39:4 Thou shalt fall upon the mountains of Israel, thou, and all thy
bands, and the people that is with thee: I will give thee unto the
ravenous birds of every sort, and to the beasts of the field to be
devoured.

39:5 Thou shalt fall upon the open field: for I have spoken it, saith
the Lord GOD.

carelessly in the isles: and they shall know that I am the LORD.

                                   Demands

When God is manifest to the World and He claims this operating system, 
publically, here's what I want:

* VMware to again support PC Speaker and provide emulation if no PC Speaker
is 
present.

* Windows and Linux will support [C:/Doc/RedSea.TXT.Z,1] RedSea file system
so I can get rid of 2,000 
lines of redundant, blemished code -- FAT32 and ISO9660.  God's temple must
be 
perfect.  I view redundant code that performs the same function as imperfect.
 
More than one filesystem type is bad, not good!

[C:/Kernel/Dsk/FileSysRedSea.CPP.Z,1]
[C:/Kernel/Dsk/FileSysFAT.CPP.Z,1]	:1004
[C:/Kernel/Dsk/FileSysISO1.CPP.Z,1]	:306
[C:/Adam/Boot/DskCDDVD.CPP.Z,1]	:536

* No secure boot.  TempleOS is a additional operating system that must be
used 
along-side Windows or Linux, not as a replacement.  It must dual boot.

* Mandate to PC hardware manufacturers: ATA/ATAPI PIO must work.

* PS2 emulated Keyboard and Mouse must work.  The BIOS must enable these.

* VMware should allow ATAPI to connect real CD/DVD hardware.

* Perhaps, VMware can enable faster than standard x86 IN/OUT instruction 
timing for ATA/ATAPI PIO, so the bandwidth isn't as bad.

* VMware and others should list TempleOS as one of the official 64-bit 
operating systems.

* Windows and Linux should support TempleOS .GRA graphics files.  These are 
just right-side-up .BMP files with 8-bit pixs 4-bits of color and 
transparency, with no palette.  Compression is an LZW compression. 
[C:/Adam/Gr/GrDC.CPP.Z,284] DCSave(), 
[C:/Adam/Gr/GrDC.CPP.Z,354] GRAWrite(), [C:/Adam/Gr/GrDC.CPP.Z,323] DCLoad(),
and [C:/Adam/Gr/GrDC.CPP.Z,365] GRARead().  [C:/Kernel/Compress.CPP.Z,1]




In other words, all hardware and BIOSes must support TempleOS as a native and 
as a virtual system, dual booted with Windows or Linux.

It would be neat if TempleOS were burned into BIOS ROMs in the factory, or 
maybe Intel CPU chips, in factory!  My hope is that it will be finished and 
largely unchanging for centuries.  I need a good dictionary, first.  Maybe,
we 
leave the dictionary out.

I do not intend to ever support UEFI.  That monstrocity uses elf and various 
propriatary graphics formats.

which thou sentest to me for: and I will do all thy desire concerning
timber of cedar, and concerning timber of fir.

5:9 My servants shall bring them down from Lebanon unto the sea: and I
will convey them by sea in floats unto the place that thou shalt
appoint me, and will cause them to be discharged there, and thou shalt
receive them: and thou shalt accomplish my desire, in giving food for
my household.

5:10 So Hiram gave Solomon cedar trees and fir trees according to all
his desire.

to his household, and twenty measures of pure oil: thus gave Solomon

so awful when you are not an atheist, LOL.  All that stuff doesn't look
nearly 
so stupid and awful.

Early in my spiritual journey, I had lots of fear and was stupid.  I have
some 
stories, though.  I went out back by a transformer that sits on top of a
sewer 
tunnel.  There was a crack with a spider web.  In the web was a huge red 
spider, LOL.  

I saw this commercial on TV for Visa or something.  It had a monk sitting 
crosslegged and wicked artificial spider were all around, "Oh, look at that!"

Anyway, it turned-out to be a red flower thing.  It looked like a large red 
daddy long-legs, sitting in a web coming from the tunnel.

I think I dropped a CDROM into that crack.  It would have proof of my 
operating system.

Now that we got God talking, you'd have to be stupid to call me a liar.

KingJamesBible (2 Chronicles 9:12) God says...
9:12 And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire,
whatsoever she asked, beside that which she had brought unto the king.
So she turned, and went away to her own land, she and her servants.

9:13 Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six
hundred and threescore and six talents of gold; 9:14 Beside that which
chapmen and merchants brought. And all the kings of Arabia and
governors of the country brought gold and silver to Solomon.

9:15 And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six
hundred shekels of beaten gold went to one target.

9:16 And three hundred shields made he of beaten gold: three hundred
shekels of gold went to one shield. And the king put them in the house
of the forest of Lebanon.

9:17 Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it
with pure gold.

Basically, RungeKutta is similar to FFTs -- you combine shit and shit and
save 
operations.  The step size offers a way to economize.  If you take smaller 
steps only around sensative spots, you can take large steps on boring
regions. 
 What you do is, it turns-out to be worth it to do extra calculations to 
estimate error.  So, you do 4th order and 5th order and you figure the 5th 
order is perfect compared to 4th order, so you get error in the 4th order by 
checking against 5th order.  Then you say, "We have too much error!  Slow 
down. Or, speed up."

KingJamesBible (Acts 27:10) God says...
and much damage, not only of the lading and ship, but also of our
lives.

27:11 Nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner of
the ship, more than those things which were spoken by Paul.

27:12 And because the haven was not commodious to winter in, the more
part advised to depart thence also, if by any means they might attain
to Phenice, and there to winter; which is an haven of Crete, and lieth
toward the south west and north west.

27:13 And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had
obtained their purpose, loosing thence, they sailed close by Crete.

27:14 But not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind,
called Euroclydon.

27:15 And when the ship was caught, and could not bear up into the
wind, we let her drive.


God does time travel biotches, ya notice yet?  Fucken retards.  That's a 
fucken tempestuous wind.

These niggers are too thick in the skull to know the danger.  Doesn't phase 
them.  A white person would say   H-O-L-Y  S-H-I-T!!! These nigger are 
unphased.

God said the eleventh commandment is, "Do not litter."  Poor China.  I have
to 
confess I can't claim to have been an environmentalist, more the opposite.

Somebody said China has problems because their people did not have morals
when 
they switched to capitalism.  I don't know about how bad it is or isn't.  
Pollution is a problem.

God likes birthrights.  It sounds unfair.  I've changed my young opinion. 
I'm 
pretty sure God is against immigration, He recently said.  I was shocked.  
Then, I thought about it.  Why is anti-immigration evil, on a philosophical 
level?  It actually solves a whole bunch of problems.  England can relax
about 
overpopulation.  There sure are a lot of busybodies.  I guess, "do not
litter" 
might apply, in a way to overpopulation.

There are wicked people who obsess and seeth with anger over population.  It 
is, undenyable, unfair.  One person shows restraint and others do not.  How 
can you say that is not unfair.  No-immigration, solves everything.  Brain 
drain?  Maybe, suddenly, those countries get better and everybody benefits.

God is perfectly just.  You can relax, a little, when you know there is a God 
who is just.  (Unless you are evil, LOL.)

KingJamesBible (Hosea 5:14) God says...
5:14 For I will be unto Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to the
house of Judah: I, even I, will tear and go away; I will take away,
and none shall rescue him.

5:15 I will go and return to my place, till they acknowledge their
offence, and seek my face: in their affliction they will seek me
early.

6:1 Come, and let us return unto the LORD: for he hath torn, and he
will heal us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us up.

6:2 After two days will he revive us: in the third day he will raise
us up, and we shall live in his sight.

6:3 Then shall we know, if we follow on to know the LORD: his going
forth is prepared as the morning; and he shall come unto us as the
rain, as the latter and former rain unto the earth.

6:4 O Ephraim, what shall I do unto thee? O Judah, what shall I do
unto thee? for your goodness is as a morning cloud, and as the early

It's funny.  I am normally the opposite of any idea which is populist.  I'm a 
snob.  I am chagrinned to be anti-immigration.  It sounds so low-class, 
working-man, labor union logic -- protectionist.  What's wrong with 
anti-immigration, though?  It's an ephiphany.  It's not evil.  
Anti-immigration is not saying, "Go starve."  There is no obvious reason 
people should flow from one country into another.  That is not normal.  It's 
just as logical -- everybody stay put.

Perhaps labor and jobs get disconnected?

I don't know.

I'm serious, though, God pretty-much said anti-immigration.

Why should we feel guilty if Latin America stays put in their own countries? 
 
We stop brain drain.  Lots of people are sneaky and smug.  God is not mocked.

KingJamesBible (Job 5:12) God says...
5:12 He disappointeth the devices of the crafty, so that their hands
cannot perform their enterprise.

5:13 He taketh the wise in their own craftiness: and the counsel of
the froward is carried headlong.

5:14 They meet with darkness in the day time, and grope in the noonday
as in the night.

5:15 But he saveth the poor from the sword, from their mouth, and from
the hand of the mighty.

5:16 So the poor hath hope, and iniquity stoppeth her mouth.

5:17 Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth: therefore despise
not thou the chastening of the Almighty: 5:18 For he maketh sore, and
bindeth up: he woundeth, and his hands make whole.

5:19 He shall deliver thee in six troubles: yea, in seven there shall
no evil touch thee.

Technically, I don't know who my doctor is.  They have actors in the stores 
and stuff.  I'm sure the nominal person I meet with is an actor.  It's a 
different person every time.  The stubbornness seems like an Indian.  It
seems 
like a stubborn atheist Indian.  Suppose you were in prison and the only way 
out was to explain a calculus problem to your guard.  Year after year after 
year would go by.  You just feel sick.  This person thinks the random number 
beacon is "bitcoin".  He thinks tongues is "Word salad."  Fucken nigger.

KingJamesBible (Job 32:9) God says...
32:9 Great men are not always wise: neither do the aged understand
judgment.

32:10 Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will shew mine opinion.

32:11 Behold, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasons,
whilst ye searched out what to say.

32:12 Yea, I attended unto you, and, behold, there was none of you
that convinced Job, or that answered his words: 32:13 Lest ye should
say, We have found out wisdom: God thrusteth him down, not man.

32:14 Now he hath not directed his words against me: neither will I
answer him with your speeches.

32:15 They were amazed, they answered no more: they left off speaking.

32:16 When I had waited, (for they spake not, but stood still, and
answered no more;) 32:17 I said, I will answer also my part, I also

A grasp on exactly what my reality is... is not my strong point.  the people 
at OSDev make me look exceptional.  Something's wrong.  I'm in prision and 
none of the smart people I know exist are in contact.  I get a wake-up call
of 
humility... almost... but the people around are not...

You know what's unfortunate?  As a kid, I thought the best thing in the world 
was progress.  Now, I frequently get scared.  Who's to say.  As a kid I 
thoughtlessly persued artificial intelligence like Frankenstein, though 
harmless.  I'm relaxed by the idea it's not easy.  I'm not certain,
obviously, 
but I'm confident.

I don't know the state of things but let's just say I'm not very impressed by 
MRI's of brains showing which regions are active.  That's obviously, 
hilariously nothing!  I hear about geneome and ... I donno... 100,000 genes?  
Whatever those things are, you are hilariuously far from anything scary.  
Sometimes, I stand-up straight and say, "I'm not far from the best.  They
seem 
pretty human."

KingJamesBible (John 21:10) God says...
21:10 Jesus saith unto them, Bring of the fish which ye have now
caught.

21:11 Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land full of great
fishes, an hundred and fifty and three: and for all there were so
many, yet was not the net broken.

21:12 Jesus saith unto them, Come and dine. And none of the disciples
durst ask him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord.

21:13 Jesus then cometh, and taketh bread, and giveth them, and fish
likewise.

21:14 This is now the third time that Jesus shewed himself to his
disciples, after that he was risen from the dead.

21:15 So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, son
of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto him, Yea,
Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my lambs.

How do I express this, I'm about to say?

There is a website called "Something awful."  It has pictures of grandma's 
that ... are depressing to any young adult... who doesn't want that
wholesome, 
family, midwestern, old, dying, woman, mother...  a San Francisco single guy 
tries to squirm away from family wholesome...  He doesn't want Mom.

Okay, so that's my description of one kind of "awful".

So, there was a young atheist me, who might have... "Why don't they search
for 
where spirituality comes from in the brain."

That is awful.  LOL.

Many of my immature thoughts are awful to me, now.

I guess you should let people mature.

I remember my mentor and friend Peter Gadwa had many things he passionately 
hated and had no tolerance of.  Now, I understand.  The young person does not 
know why buttons get pushed in mentors, but an old adult like me, may be 
seeing his old thought patterns which he, now, has contempt for.  (Or, could 
be other stuff.)  The old thoughst are unpleasant memories -- you want to 
squirm and get away.

KingJamesBible (1 Timothy 3:5) God says...
(For if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take
care of the church of God?)  3:6 Not a novice, lest being lifted up
with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil.

3:7 Moreover he must have a good report of them which are without;
lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.

3:8 Likewise must the deacons be grave, not doubletongued, not given
to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre; 3:9 Holding the mystery of
the faith in a pure conscience.

3:10 And let these also first be proved; then let them use the office
of a deacon, being found blameless.

3:11 Even so must their wives be grave, not slanderers, sober,
faithful in all things.

3:12 Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their
children and their own houses well.

I like Knuth.

I like my Mom.

I'm about average on reaction to old people.  It's doesn't cross my mind.  
That site "Something awful", though, shows pictures of old ladies.  That's 
their strange theme for the site.  Weird site.

I guess my operating system must seem awful.  Maybe, some people want it out 
of sight.

I have become a vicious freak. Maybe, I'm like a war veteran.  I don't fit-in 
for sure.

I said Jews were "hideously viscious" cornered animals.

I'm hideously viscious.

It's not pleasant when you fear technology advancing more than looking
forward 
to it.

Those robots were kinda hideous, LOL.  I don't want to ban stuff.  Some
people 
sabotage progress.

My ridiculously awful operating system looks wonderfully harmless.  It's
good, 
though.

If you want to be a hero, find something pleasant and peaceful for people to 
do, ideally making money.  I suggest making hymns.  Nobody does that for more 
than an hour here or there.  It's nice getting God to talk, though.

KingJamesBible (Proverbs 5:12) God says...
I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof; 5:13 And have not
obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined mine ear to them that
instructed me!  5:14 I was almost in all evil in the midst of the
congregation and assembly.

5:15 Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out of
thine own well.

5:16 Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad, and rivers of waters in
the streets.

5:17 Let them be only thine own, and not strangers' with thee.

5:18 Let thy fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thy
youth.

satisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always with her love.
