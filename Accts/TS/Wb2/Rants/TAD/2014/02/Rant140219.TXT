                                   Demands

When God is manifest to the World and He claims this operating system, 
publically, here's what I want:

* VMware to again support PC Speaker and provide emulation if no PC Speaker
is 
present.

* Windows and Linux will support [C:/Doc/RedSea.TXT.Z,1] RedSea file system
so I can get rid of 2,000 
lines of redundant, blemished code -- FAT32 and ISO9660.  God's temple must
be 
perfect.  I view redundant code that performs the same function as imperfect.
 
More than one filesystem type is bad, not good!

[C:/Kernel/Dsk/FileSysRedSea.CPP.Z,1]
[C:/Kernel/Dsk/FileSysFAT.CPP.Z,1]	:1004
[C:/Kernel/Dsk/FileSysISO1.CPP.Z,1]	:306
[C:/Adam/Boot/DskCDDVD.CPP.Z,1]	:536

* No secure boot.  TempleOS is a additional operating system that must be
used 
along-side Windows or Linux, not as a replacement.  It must dual boot.

* Mandate to PC hardware manufacturers: ATA/ATAPI PIO must work.

* PS2 emulated Keyboard and Mouse must work.  The BIOS must enable these.

* VMware should allow ATAPI to connect real CD/DVD hardware.

* Perhaps, VMware can enable faster than standard x86 IN/OUT instruction 
timing for ATA/ATAPI PIO, so the bandwidth isn't as bad.

* VMware and others should list TempleOS as one of the official 64-bit 
operating systems.

* Windows and Linux should support TempleOS .GRA graphics files.  These are 
just right-side-up .BMP files with 8-bit pixs 4-bits of color and 
transparency, with no palette.  Compression comes from the
[C:/Doc/RedSea.TXT.Z,1] RedSea .Z LZW 
compression.  (Let me know when you want it.)  [C:/Adam/Gr/GrDC.CPP.Z,284]
DCSave(), [C:/Adam/Gr/GrDC.CPP.Z,354] GRAWrite(), [C:/Adam/Gr/GrDC.CPP.Z,323]
DCLoad(), 
and [C:/Adam/Gr/GrDC.CPP.Z,365] GRARead().  [C:/Kernel/Compress.CPP.Z,1]




In other words, all hardware and BIOSes must support TempleOS as a native and 
as a virtual system, dual booted with Windows or Linux.

It would be neat if TempleOS were burned into BIOS ROMs in the factory, or 
maybe Intel CPU chips, in factory!  My hope is that it will be finished and 
largely unchanging for centuries.  I need a good dictionary, first.  Maybe,
we 
leave the dictionary out.

I do not intend to ever support UEFI.  That monstrocity uses elf and various 
propriatary graphics formats.

I want to get rid of FAT32 and ISO9660 and only have RedSea filesystem.  The 
RedSea stores files contiguously, so they cannot grow.  You read and write
the 
whole file and use compression.

Currently, [C:/Kernel/Dsk/DskCFile.CPP.Z,181] FWBlks() will grow a files if
FAT32.  I am going to eliminate that, 
however.

To achieve [C:/Demo/Dsk/FPrintF.CPP.Z,1] fprintf() you write to a document in
memory and [C:/Adam/Doc/DocFile.CPP.Z,185] DocWrite() the 
whole thing to disk.  Appending to a log files is not possible -- my C64 
vision.  Use Windows or Linux.

printf()?  My [C:/Kernel/StrPrint.CPP.Z,247] SPrintJoin() family has no size
limit -- they expand.  Look at 
[C:/Kernel/StrPrint.CPP.Z,14] SPutChar(), a private function used by

Most things are allocated on the heap and have no limit.  In fact they will

I wrote my own assembler.  It does a shitty job of 16-bit because that is not 
needed very much and the lowest line count (for my assembler) is my goal.


A PCI device has config-space registers that you access with the
[C:/Kernel/BIOS32.CPP.Z,1] PCI BIOS32.  
You can learn the ports it has, perhaps, for IDE/ATA/SATA port-I/O.  That's 
actually very hard to do.

Not all hard disks have PIO, you must do the PCI DMA.  The PCI device has 
memory-space-mapped (not I/O ports) registers.  You use those for setting-up 
the DMA, I guess.  I did HDAUdio, similarly.  Perhaps, you are wise to use
the 
memroy-address range that the BIOS set-up for the PCI device.  I reconfigured 
HD Audio because I wasn't sure if whateever range was sitting in the BAR for 
HDAudio was good.

----02/19/14 23:32:08----

I have done everything I plan to do.  I will never support PCI devices.  
Instead, we will use VMware until hardware companies decide to support 
ATA/ATAPI PIO and legacy PS/2 keyboard mouse.

Over the centuries, new hardware interfaces will be made that try for minimum 
line count drivers, now that God's temple is manifest.

If you look at GPUs, we can do nothing in the current situation that fits 
within our 100,000 total line of code limit for the operating system.  If 
Intel puts the GPU on-board and there is just one GPU driver needed, we could 
support it, however, I like the transparancy in my graphics code.

In 64-bit mode CS,DS,SS and ES are treated as zero.  FS and GS you can change 
by setting a model specific register.  I used them for my current task and 
current CPU records.  You cannot use a displacement off of the Fs or Gs 
because they are always RIP relative.  With no segment override [Memory] is 
RIP relative and it is useful.  With Fs or Gs override, it is still RIP 
relative and not useful.

I'm smarter than you.

When I start-up my multicore CPUs, they go through initialization.  The last 
part of initialization involves setting the RIP in the CPU record and 
restoring a context.

When I have a CPU idling, I use a special task called an IDLE TASK.  When an 
interrupt occurs, it does a context restore and runs the next normal task.  
The brute-force technique to shove the Idle task onto its HLT involves 
manhandling the task by setting RSP to the end of the idle task stack and 
executing the HLT.

KingJamesBible (1 Kings 9:25) God says...
9:25 And three times in a year did Solomon offer burnt offerings and
peace offerings upon the altar which he built unto the LORD, and he
burnt incense upon the altar that was before the LORD. So he finished
the house.

9:26 And king Solomon made a navy of ships in Eziongeber, which is
beside Eloth, on the shore of the Red sea, in the land of Edom.

9:27 And Hiram sent in the navy his servants, shipmen that had
knowledge of the sea, with the servants of Solomon.

9:28 And they came to Ophir, and fetched from thence gold, four
hundred and twenty talents, and brought it to king Solomon.

10:1 And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon
concerning the name of the LORD, she came to prove him with hard
questions.

10:2 And she came to Jerusalem with a very great train, with camels

KingJamesBible (Jeremiah 27:14) God says...
saying, Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon: for they prophesy a
lie unto you.

27:15 For I have not sent them, saith the LORD, yet they prophesy a
lie in my name; that I might drive you out, and that ye might perish,
ye, and the prophets that prophesy unto you.

27:16 Also I spake to the priests and to all this people, saying, Thus
saith the LORD; Hearken not to the words of your prophets that
prophesy unto you, saying, Behold, the vessels of the LORD's house
shall now shortly be brought again from Babylon: for they prophesy a
lie unto you.

27:17 Hearken not unto them; serve the king of Babylon, and live:
wherefore should this city be laid waste?  27:18 But if they be
prophets, and if the word of the LORD be with them, let them now make
intercession to the LORD of hosts, that the vessels which are left in
the house of the LORD, and in the house of the king of Judah, and at
Jerusalem, go not to Babylon.

KingJamesBible (Zephaniah 2:14) God says...
shall be in the thresholds; for he shall uncover the cedar work.

2:15 This is the rejoicing city that dwelt carelessly, that said in
her heart, I am, and there is none beside me: how is she become a
desolation, a place for beasts to lie down in! every one that passeth
by her shall hiss, and wag his hand.

3:1 Woe to her that is filthy and polluted, to the oppressing city!
3:2 She obeyed not the voice; she received not correction; she trusted
not in the LORD; she drew not near to her God.

3:3 Her princes within her are roaring lions; her judges are evening
wolves; they gnaw not the bones till the morrow.

3:4 Her prophets are light and treacherous persons: her priests have
polluted the sanctuary, they have done violence to the law.

3:5 The just LORD is in the midst thereof; he will not do iniquity:
every morning doth he bring his judgment to light, he faileth not; but
the unjust knoweth no shame.

The Revelation of Saint John the Devine


1:1 The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to shew
unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass; and he sent
and signified it by his angel unto his servant John: 1:2 Who bare
record of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, and
of all things that he saw.

prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein: for the
time is at hand.

Electron Measurement

What do You think of the electron mass measurement, God?  They got it down to

24:45 And before I had done speaking in mine heart, behold, Rebekah
came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down unto
the well, and drew water: and I said unto her, Let me drink, I pray
thee.

24:46 And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her shoulder,
and said, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: so I drank,
and she made the camels drink also.

24:47 And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou? And she
said, the daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bare unto him:
and I put the earring upon her face, and the bracelets upon her hands.

24:48 And I bowed down my head, and worshipped the LORD, and blessed
the LORD God of my master Abraham, which had led me in the right way
to take my master's brother's daughter unto his son.

through this thing ye shall prolong your days in the land, whither ye

itself could not contain the books that should be written. Amen.

maintain the cause of his servant, and the cause of his people Israel
at all times, as the matter shall require: 8:60 That all the people of

I have too much to say.  I can easily fill five pages, but it should be a

his camp is very great: for he is strong that executeth his word: for
the day of the LORD is great and very terrible; and who can abide it?

your heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning:
2:13 And rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto the
LORD your God: for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of
great kindness, and repenteth him of the evil.

2:14 Who knoweth if he will return and repent, and leave a blessing
behind him; even a meat offering and a drink offering unto the LORD
your God?  2:15 Blow the trumpet in Zion, sanctify a fast, call a
solemn assembly: 2:16 Gather the people, sanctify the congregation,
