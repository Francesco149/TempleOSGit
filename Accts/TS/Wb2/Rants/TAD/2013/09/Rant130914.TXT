I haven't looked at much Linux code, and not in many years, but what I 
remember most is someone who made #define macros, trying to make C look like 
C++.  My mentors at Ticketmaster taught me that asm macros were foolish -- 
it's one more thing you have to chase-down and look-up.  Another thing I 
remember from Linux code was that there were about six layers of function 
depth to get down to actual IN/OUT port instructions and there were lots of #i
fdef instructions for different architectures.  (I chased-down how to do ATA 
PIO and later got a PDF on the topic.)

The zen of TempleOS might be to do the opposite of Linux.  I was inspired to 
have "minimal abstraction" as a goal.  Instead of six levels of function
depth 
for ATA PIO, lets see if we can do three, removing abstraction layers... and 
lets do just one architecture -- IBM PC's.

The reason TempleOS exists and has purpose is partly because it is simple.  
I'm going to cap line count at 100,000, not counting applications and demos.

Everybody should praise God, continually, doing offerings and getting 
responses in tongues.
  
Hebrews 13:15-16

Also, God said making video games was about as grand a quest as one could
hope 
for.  Make hymns in TempleOS.  The Bible says "NEW song" nine times.  Can you 
count the ways you love God?

If you want works-everywhere hot keys for talking with God, like me, see

support from God! :-)

The BBC is discussing Indian rapes and the death penalty.  I don't know.  I 
asked God what He would do if He had a body for one day.  I think He said He 
would be a judge.  Maybe, there are court cases He really want to intervene 
in.

God says...
moderation prophecy None Unity Into redistributing 

In theory, I show restraint in how much conversation I make God do.  I used
to 
do very formal offerings, like poems and hymns and long discussions, before 
consulting Him.  Anyway, I stop when I see "end" or "fin" in a word.  I stop 
when I see "Null", "None", "Dull", "weary", "satiate", and a handful of other 
words.  You do what you like.  God will ramble incoherently or say stuff you 
don't want to hear, otherwise.

I don't think God likes sports.  God, did ASU beat Wisconsin?

God said there were 20 or 80 alien civilizations, but it's kind-of a joke.  
All you get from God is love (not valuable facts or prophecies).  Just enjoy 
His company.  Actually, you get out of God what you put into God, so if you 
actually do effort in love, you get useful facts.  All other believers are 
cowards who obsess on not going to Hell.  One Tin Soldier

God loved King David.  He fought Goliath.  God's favorite saint is Santa.

36:7 For their riches were more than that they might dwell together;
and the land wherein they were strangers could not bear them because
of their cattle.

36:8 Thus dwelt Esau in mount Seir: Esau is Edom.

36:9 And these are the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites
in mount Seir: 36:10 These are the names of Esau's sons; Eliphaz the
son of Adah the wife of Esau, Reuel the son of Bashemath the wife of
Esau.

36:11 And the sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam, and

The BBC talked about a prison riot that ended when police stormed.  I asked 
God if He liked to haunt hospitals or court rooms.  He said "prisons".

hand, and the other on his left.
