I saw a story of a church converted to a book store.  I don't love neighbor;
I 
love God.  When you look at what people do to show love to God, it's really 
sad. Nice churches are about the only thing.  I saw a nice, modern church.

said, "secular glass."  It made my cry.

6:17 And these are the golden emerods which the Philistines returned
for a trespass offering unto the LORD; for Ashdod one, for Gaza one,
for Askelon one, for Gath one, for Ekron one; 6:18 And the golden
mice, according to the number of all the cities of the Philistines
belonging to the five lords, both of fenced cities, and of country
villages, even unto the great stone of Abel, whereon they set down the
ark of the LORD: which stone remaineth unto this day in the field of
Joshua, the Bet

LOL!  That's from when they stole the Ark.  It gave them hemeroids, so they 
returned it.

I have little birds -- Percival and Tomorrow.  God named them.  You're not 
supposed to test God.  I used to never do anything to force God to act, just 
let Him comment, if He felt like it.  If you force God to act, just realize
He 
might not do it.  I joke that God would shoot hostages.

Go up to Hilkiah the
high priest, that he may sum the silver which is brought into the
house of the LORD, which the keepers of the door have gathered of the

work, that have the oversight of the house of the LORD: and let them
give it to the doers of the work which is in the house of the LORD, to
repair the breaches of the house, 22:6 Unto carpenters, and builders,

I don't go to church.  I made God's temple!  I'm not very normal.  I wouldn't

long road.  Sometimes, I say I "graduated" from Catholicism, being serious,

One time, Mom wanted me to go venerate the Eucharist.  They think God is in 
the bread and they keep Him company.  Jesus said, "Where two or more are 
gathered, I'm in your midst."  So, I said to Mom, "What do we need to go over 
there for?"  Perhaps, the Eucharist is a dead chunk of flesh and a live
spirit 
is present when you talk to each other.  Spirits do make you say stuff.  You 
can hear spirits in yourself and others when you talk.
