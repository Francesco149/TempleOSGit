Chuck Swindoll's book, Wisdom for the Way, is really good.

Solitude removes bitterness.
Obscurity removes pride.
Time removes fear.

I heard a really pleasing quote elsewhere.

Learn modesty from the elephant.

That quote is a clever way to praise God.  Sit down, some time and look at
the 
Bible from an author point-of-view.  Your eyes will be opened to seeing it as 
poetry that praises the Father.  i.e. "Look to the ant, thou sluggard."  The 
book of Job is full of many many created things.

Jesus said the Father makes sure the birds have food.  He got that from the 
Old Testament.

God says...
5:22 Though ye offer me burnt offerings and your meat offerings, I
will not accept them: neither will I regard the peace offerings of
your fat beasts.

5:23 Take thou away from me the noise of thy songs; for I will not
hear the melody of thy viols.

5:24 But let judgment run down as waters, and righteousness as a
mighty stream.

5:25 Have ye offered unto me sacrifices and offerings in the
wilderness forty years, O house of Israel?  5:26 But ye have borne the
tabernacle of your Moloch and Chiun your images,

That's about Chinese-like spirituality.  Confucisism.

God, You have no taste -- the elephant quote is awesome!

One time God told me to get a job or something.  I said I was a better person 
when I was employed and an atheist before He talked to me.  He said, "That's 
your opinion."

That's actually a profound thought -- we don't have to have the same opinion 
as God.

There is justice, highs and lows, balancing.  Then, there is your personal 
relationship with God.  It's really good to keep them separate.

God called sports and pets, "homo".  That's kinda bad, but God said He loves 
gays, one time.

LORD?  4:12 Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach
thee what thou shalt say.

4:13 And he said, O my LORD, send, I pray thee, by the hand of him
whom thou wilt send.

4:14 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Moses, and he said,
Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother? I know that he can speak well.
And also, behold, he cometh forth to meet thee: and when he seeth
thee, he will be glad in his heart.

4:15 And thou shalt speak unto him, and put words in his mouth: and I
will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what ye
shall do.

4:16 And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people: and he shall be,
even he shall be to thee instead of a mouth, and thou shalt be to him
instead of God.

4:17 And thou shalt take this rod in thine hand, wherewith thou shalt
do signs.

Jacob "wrestled an angel" which is something I, too, have done.  God loved 
Jacob and hated Esau.  I heard one preacher say that Jacob "tussled" with God.

Look at the story of [C:/TempleOS/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,74697] Jonah,1:1.

a night, and perished in a night: 4:11 And should not I spare Nineveh,
that great city, wherein are more then sixscore thousand persons that
cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand; and also
much cattle?

When people are called cattle and you are listening to the radio talk about 
animals, you might have a twilight zone moment.

I think a good Stephen King might actually have mercy.  Once, I read the Dune

A Chinese person has probably figured-out highs and lows balancing.  We are 
not Chinese -- our religion is supposed to be about the person of God, not 
mechanics of justice.

The purpose of life is to know God, love God and obey God.  The story of Cain 
and Abel is pretty-much good enough.  Do offerings, see if God likes them, 
passionately love God so much, you kill out of jealousy.  Hell is the absense 
of God, my Mom said.  Heaven must be God's company.  You don't love God, you 
just fear hell.  God loved David most and David was the opposite of a coward.

"If it's bad, must be good" is probably correct, if you want to be Chinese. 
I 
suggest a compass of, "Does this glorify God?"

My printed Bible says, "It is love that I desire, not sacrifice; Knowledge of 
God, not holocaust."  Well, of course, Abba! It also says, "Do I drink the 
blood of bulls?  Offer praise as your sacrifice, then call on me and I will 
rescue you."

Your love got perverted and inverted.

This might be relevant. Ezekial 16 Jesus said if you pray in public you have

I asked if, "Thou I walk through the valley of death I will fear no evil."

4:26 But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us
all.

4:27 For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not; break
forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for the desolate hath many

I don't want to remind people of the Irish potato famine.  It is shameful.

Any time God punishes you, it's shameful, overpopulating and being lazy and 
stupid with one crop is shameful.

In the Bible, God punished the Jews a hundred times.  Any Jew with sense is 
ashamed of the WWII holocaust.  They fucked-up... again.

Now... fuck that. I hate it when people think "Irish" any time they hear

Most bears eat berries and plants, what about polar bears, I'm curious.

but it's really shocking to see a bear do a strip tease -- too human.  I

it's not unusual for animals.  I was shocked.  Weirdly disturbing.

WWW.OSDEV.ORG is asking how to print floats in PrintF().

Earlier I said I had a teacher who made us handle NEG 0x80 to the nth degree.
 
That's being a professional programmer.  Maybe, I'm an artistic faggot, but I 
want to dance my own way.  I want to be different and elegant by not doing
all 
those corner cases, if they're not especially needed. 

It turns-out I have a really fast routine for, say, "%12.6f".  On numbers,
you 
go backward.  I use a stack data structure to reverse digits.  I look at the 
6.    I forget.  I think I subtract the integer part from decimal.  Then, I 
multiply by 10 to the 6th from an array look-up table.  Then, I make it into
a 
64-bit integer and print push the digits on the stack, like you would expect.
 
I print the zeros and the decimal.  I print the Int, or if I have to multiply 
it, I multiply by a look-up table power ot ten array.

(This cuts corners, makes beautiful use of having 64-bit word size, is
elegant 
and fast.  Unfortuinately, printf is silly being ultra fast.  I get problems 
if you specify "%50.30f"  Mine craps-out, unless the number is tiny.  It 
sounds bad, but you just have to be careful not to overdo precision. It gives 
you all the precision in the double, but if you do way more than a double
has, 
well mine fucks up.  Don't over do the format size beyond 64-bit integer 
sitting in the decimal region.

At ticketmaster, I saw a luxury ultra-delux main-frame VAX environment.  We 
had a format statement that would do commas or decimals every so many 
characters, use a special digit for decimal point and pad the whole thing
with 
a character.

Mine will do 3-digit commas and a decimal.  

I have an engineering notation.

For integers, mine will print Meg or K, if you like.
