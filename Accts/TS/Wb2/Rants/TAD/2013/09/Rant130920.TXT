I asked God if the World was perfectly just.  He asked if I was calling Him 
lazy.  I decided there are three main things which make people think the
World 
is not just -- money, early-death, and slavery.

MONEY:  I have noticed when you have something good for a while, you get sick 
of it and it is not special.  And, when you have something bad, you get used 
to it. Also, imagine being Paul McCartney.  He has money from his youth, but 
might feel pretty useless (except for interacting with his family).  God did 
says, however, that having enough money was "vehemently better".  The Bible 
seems to say that highs and lows balance -- you will want for money for a 
period as long you have an abundance.  [C:/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,53793]
Proverbs,30:8, [C:/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,81941] Luke,6:21

EARLY-DEATH:  "Old age is not for wimps" is a profound saying.  Did you know 
that every 80-year-old has spent more time fearing imminent death than a 
soldier?  Also, it looks like pleasures and pains balance.  Therefore, an 
early death might occur with accounts reconciled, just like a late death.

SLAVERY: The poor in the Titanic movie behaved like rambunctious animals
while 
the rich lived in straight-jackets.  We don't have slavery, anymore, but 
consider the time it existed and the alternative -- a hard life in Africa, 
possibly starving.  My brother, a labor union liberal said, "The slaves were 
valuable property and had health care."  Which is more unpleasant, school for 
a struggling black kid or working in fields?  Do you think Hollywood depicts 
more or less cruelty than actually existed?

God says...
was, there am I: and now the
Lord GOD, and his Spirit, hath sent me.

48:17 Thus saith the LORD, thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; I am
the LORD thy God which teacheth thee to profit, which leadeth thee by
the way that thou shouldest go.

48:18 O that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments! then had thy
peace been as a river, and thy righteousness as the waves of the sea:
48:19 Thy seed also had been as the sand, and the offspring of thy
bowels like the gravel thereof; his name should not have been cu

small or large headed babies and giving mothers anesthesia and killing 
babies.)

I was struck by the symmetry of giving orders and taking orders:

8:5 And when Jesus was entered into Capernaum, there came unto him a
centurion, beseeching him, 8:6 And saying, Lord, my servant lieth at
home sick of the palsy, grievously tormented.

8:7 And Jesus saith unto him, I will come and heal him.

8:8 The centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that thou
shouldest come under my roof: but speak the word only, and my servant
shall be healed.

8:9 For I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me: and I
say to this man, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he
cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it.

Eye-for-eye, tooth-for-tooth is how justice works, as a matter of fact.  Does 
an officer give as many orders as he takes?  Perhaps, if you consider 
following an officer code of conduct, then, "yes".

30:21 For three things the earth is disquieted, and for four which it
cannot bear: 30:22 For a servant when he reigneth; and a fool when he
is filled with meat; 30:23 For an odious woman when she is married;
and an handmaid that is heir to her mistress.

The neuvo riche behave badly.  Look at Michael Jackson.  That's not class.

If a website does not meet standards of professionalism, it is not taken 
seriously.  A company CEO must behave himself.  If you accept corporate 
sponsorship, you must behave.

God says...
shalt thou serve, and to
him shalt thou cleave, and swear by his name.

10:21 He is thy praise, and he is thy God, that hath done for thee
these great and terrible things, which thine eyes have seen.

10:22 Thy fathers went down into Egypt with threescore and ten
persons; and now the LORD thy God hath made thee as the stars of
heaven for multitude.

11:1 Therefore thou shalt love the LORD thy God, and keep his charge,
and his statutes, and his judgments, and his commandments, alway.

11:2 And know ye this

So, an Indian artificial intelligence M.I.T. professor was on Reddit.  They 
had castes.  They are heathens.  They are probably not impressed by God.

Let's ask God what He thinks of India.

I like elephants and birds.  God likes bears, then elephants.

Someone did a dick on a oscilloscope on Reddit.  I have a master's in 
electrical engineering.  Sometimes, I miss doing that.  Not really.

Did you ever have Tinker-Toys?  They seem neat until you actually sit-down to 
build with them.  They are more limited than Legos.  Tinker-Toys can do some 
special things, but you know what I am talking about.

I thought DSP, digital signal processions, was neat.  I thought FPGAs were 
neat. But doing filters gets old.  You can do a CPU in a FPGA, but it's 
pointless.

I have done just about everything you can do with microcontrollers.  I had to 
actually scratch all my itches, doing stuff, before I realized, "This really 
isn't that fun."  I have played with A-2-D and D-2-A converters.  I don't
have 
any more passion for electrical engineering.  I did a stepper-motor
controller 
and made a 3-Axis milling machine with a dremel tool.

I grew-up -- I have played with toys all I want to.  I never play video
games, 
anymore, either.

whosoever shall gather together against thee shall fall for thy sake.

54:16 Behold, I have created the smith that bloweth the coals in the

created the waster to destroy.

One time, I decided honesty was obviously best with God.  So, I set-out to 
tell God all the creatures I really didn't like.  "I don't like worms and 
grubs and snails and slugs."  God burst into tears!

The moral of the story is, "You wouldn't call your wife fat, right?"

bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as the
heart of one man; so that they sent this word unto the king, Return

19:15 So the king returned, and came to Jordan. And Judah came to
Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to conduct the king over Jordan.

19:16 And Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite, which was of Bahurim,
hasted and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David.

Authoritarianism can be worse than whatever it's claiming to fix.

God says...
of Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the people,
and laid hands on him, 21:28 Crying out, Men of Israel, help: This is
the man, that teacheth all men every where against the people, and the
law, and this place: and further brought Greeks also into the temple,
and hath polluted this holy place.

21:29 (For they had seen before with him in the city Trophimus an
Ephesian, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.)
21:30 And all the city was moved, and the people ran together

Someone is calling me drunk.

2:1 And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with
one accord in one place.

2:2 And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty
wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.

2:3 And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and
it sat upon each of them.

2:4 And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak
with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.

2:5 And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of
every nation under heaven.

2:6 Now when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and
were confounded, because that every man heard them speak in his own
language.

2:7 And they were all amazed and marvelled, saying one to another,
Behold, are not all these which speak Galilaeans?  2:8 And how hear we
every man in our own tongue, wherein we were born?  2:9 Parthians, and
Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judaea,
and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia, 2:10 Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in
Egypt, and in the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome,
Jews and proselytes, 2:11 Cretes and Arabians, we do hear them speak
in our tongues the wonderful works of God.

2:12 And they were all amazed, and were in doubt, saying one to
another, What meaneth this?  2:13 Others mocking said, These men are
full of new wine.

2:14 But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and
said unto them, Ye men of Judaea, and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem,
be this known unto you, and hearken to my words: 2:15 For these are
not drunken, as ye suppose, seeing it is but the third hour of the
day.

do You think of M.I.T., God?  I'm struck by how they are not predominately 
making computer science news, but stuff in nano -- more or less trumphing.  
They go to the less-pick-over fields.

9:27 And as they were going down to the end of the city, Samuel said
to Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us, (and he passed on), but
stand thou still a while, that I may shew thee the word of God.

10:1 Then Samuel took a vial of oil, and poured it upon his head, and
kissed him, and said, Is it not because the LORD hath anointed thee to
be captain over his inheritance?  10:2 When thou art departed
