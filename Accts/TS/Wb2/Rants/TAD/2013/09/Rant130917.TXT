unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that
is, God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.

19:18 He saith unto him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shalt do no murder,
Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not
bear false witness, 19:19 Honour thy father and thy mother: and, Thou
shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.

In 1993, I wrote a TASM program that launched from real-mode DOS as a DOS 
application and changed to protected mode.  I got multitasking, windowing and 
echoing keyboard to text mode working... and set it aside.  I did many 
projects like that.  I did an A2D D2A ISA card for my computer that measured 
bode plots and calculated induction.  I did SySSim, the predecessor to 
SimStructure.  The ISA card data aquisition project was my favorite.

In 2004, I got my code and ran it with TASM and FreeDOS.  I used VC editor
for 
long editing sessions by booting to windows.  FreeDOS is no-longer real-mode.

After getting keyboard functioning, I had to do command-line.  I made a C/C++ 
JIT interpretor in ASM.  I had done that for SimStructure and had done 
expression evaluators -- byte-code generating for the Ticketmaster Report 
Generator in 1991.

I inlined and patched the templates for byte-code operations, making a true, 
unoptimized compiler.  I optimized over the next ten years and converted as 
much ASM to HolyC as possible.  The HolyC language gradually evolved.

The World is perfectly just.
If you say the world sucks, that's the opposite of praising God.
You think God wants to fucken hear complaining?

When someone makes-up unflattering shit about themselves, you know it's true.

11:1 And when the people complained, it displeased the LORD: and the
LORD heard it; and his anger was kindled; and the fire of the LORD
burnt among them, and consumed them that were in the uttermost parts
of the camp.

11:2 And the people cried unto Moses; and when Moses prayed unto the
LORD, the fire was quenched.

11:3 And he called the name of the place Taberah: because the fire of
the LORD burnt among them.

11:4 And the mixt multitude that was among them fell a lusting: and
the children of Israel also wept again, and said, Who shall give us
flesh to eat?  11:5 We remember the fish, which we did eat in Egypt
freely; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions,
and the garlick: 11:6 But now our soul is dried away: there is nothing
at all, beside this manna, before our eyes.

11:7 And the manna was as coriander seed, and the colour thereof as
the colour of bdellium.

11:8 And the people went about, and gathered it, and ground it in
mills, or beat it in a mortar, and baked it in pans, and made cakes of
it: and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil.

11:9 And when the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell
upon it.

11:10 Then Moses heard the people weep throughout their families,
every man in the door of his tent: and the anger of the LORD was
kindled greatly; Moses also was displeased.

11:11 And Moses said unto the LORD, Wherefore hast thou afflicted thy
servant? and wherefore have I not found favour in thy sight, that thou
layest the burden of all this people upon me?  11:12 Have I conceived
all this people? have I begotten them, that thou shouldest say unto
me, Carry them in thy bosom, as a nursing father beareth the sucking
child, unto the land which thou swarest unto their fathers?  11:13
Whence should I have flesh to give unto all this people? for they weep
unto me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat.

11:14 I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too
heavy for me.

11:15 And if thou deal thus with me, kill me, I pray thee, out of
hand, if I have found favour in thy sight; and let me not see my
wretchedness.

11:16 And the LORD said unto Moses, Gather unto me seventy men of the
elders of Israel, whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people,
and officers over them; and bring them unto the tabernacle of the
congregation, that they may stand there with thee.

11:17 And I will come down and talk with thee there: and I will take
of the spirit which is upon thee, and will put it upon them; and they
shall bear the burden of the people with thee, that thou bear it not
thyself alone.

11:18 And say thou unto the people, Sanctify yourselves against to
morrow, and ye shall eat flesh: for ye have wept in the ears of the
LORD, saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat? for it was well with us
in Egypt: therefore the LORD will give you flesh, and ye shall eat.

11:19 Ye shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither
ten days, nor twenty days; 11:20 But even a whole month, until it come
out at your nostrils, and it be loathsome unto you: because that ye
have despised the LORD which is among you, and have wept before him,
saying, Why came we forth out of Egypt?  11:21 And Moses said, The
people, among whom I am, are six hundred thousand footmen; and thou
hast said, I will give them flesh, that they may eat a whole month.

11:22 Shall the flocks and the herds be slain for them, to suffice
them?  or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them,
to suffice them?  11:23 And the LORD said unto Moses, Is the LORD's
hand waxed short? thou shalt see now whether my word shall come to
pass unto thee or not.

11:24 And Moses went out, and told the people the words of the LORD,
and gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them
round about the tabernacle.

11:25 And the LORD came down in a cloud, and spake unto him, and took
of the spirit that was upon him, and gave it unto the seventy elders:
and it came to pass, that, when the spirit rested upon them, they
prophesied, and did not cease.

11:26 But there remained two of the men in the camp, the name of the
one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: and the spirit rested
upon them; and they were of them that were written, but went not out
unto the tabernacle: and they prophesied in the camp.

11:27 And there ran a young man, and told Moses, and said, Eldad and
Medad do prophesy in the camp.

11:28 And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Moses, one of his
young men, answered and said, My lord Moses, forbid them.

11:29 And Moses said unto him, Enviest thou for my sake? would God
that all the LORD's people were prophets, and that the LORD would put
his spirit upon them!  11:30 And Moses gat him into the camp, he and
the elders of Israel.

11:31 And there went forth a wind from the LORD, and brought quails
from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, as it were a day's
journey on this side, and as it were a day's journey on the other
side, round about the camp, and as it were two cubits high upon the
face of the earth.

11:32 And the people stood up all that day, and all that night, and
all the next day, and they gathered the quails: he that gathered least
gathered ten homers: and they spread them all abroad for themselves
round about the camp.

11:33 And while the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it was
chewed, the wrath of the LORD was kindled against the people, and the
LORD smote the people with a very great plague.

11:34 And he called the name of that place Kibrothhattaavah: because
there they buried the people that lusted.

11:35 And the people journeyed from Kibrothhattaavah unto Hazeroth;
and abode at Hazeroth.

Highs and lows balance.

6:20 And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, Blessed be
ye poor: for yours is the kingdom of God.

6:21 Blessed are ye that hunger now: for ye shall be filled. Blessed
are ye that weep now: for ye shall laugh.

6:22 Blessed are ye, when men shall hate you, and when they shall
separate you from their company, and shall reproach you, and cast out
your name as evil, for the Son of man's sake.

6:23 Rejoice ye in that day, and leap for joy: for, behold, your
reward is great in heaven: for in the like manner did their fathers
unto the prophets.

6:24 But woe unto you that are rich! for ye have received your
consolation.

6:25 Woe unto you that are full! for ye shall hunger. Woe unto you
that laugh now! for ye shall mourn and weep.

6:26 Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you! for so did
their fathers to the false prophets.

There's this batshit crazy quote from the Old Testament, "Give me neither 
riches nor poverty, but that which is my portion."

Praise God or else.

Suppose you want to make a JIT compiler.

You invent commands, kinda like ASM instructions.  You parse and construct
the 
memory structure for the "commands".  You overhaul them, optimizing.  Then
you 
convert them to machine code.  You MAlloc a chunk of memory and you put the 
machine code into it.  You make a symbol table for each function and class.  
Then, you look-up symbols as you do more JIT for the next function.  All 
memory is identity-mapped -- nothing to think about.  Each task calls MAlloc 
when it compiles for unique memory to place the code into.  Each task gets 
different memory from malloc -- no duplicates.  It's identity mapped, 
basically just physical addresses.  

It gets more complicated if you want to do ordinary compiling.  You have to 
put the code into the file, then you make some kinda structure for you symbol 
import and exports.  Write it to file.  Load it by getting memory, using the 
JIT symbol table.

Damn, old people are laid back, somewhat, mellow.

My only contact with Gen Y was an artist I hired.

Cody Rigby and he needed me to send a computer.  "Mike Kunt"
Said his real name was "Cody Smedly"

I was kind expecting docile boring, but He had initiative.  I had a game, 
thoughtlessly called "Goons".  It was supposed to be Mobstirs shuffling
along. 
 It didn't make much sense, come to think about it.  He thought it should be 
Zombies, because "Zombies were trending."

He snuck penises into all the art.  I was upset when I figured it out.  Kinda 
entertained.  Disney had homo artist problems.  Yeah, I got a genuine artist 
-- he's homo.  His art was good, sept the homo fucken nasty shit.  I had a
day 
of truth when I kinda admitted his art was better than I could do.  I grew-up 
thinking I could mostly do art or whatever, maybe.

As I think about it, it's possible I lead him to believe I was homo, or 
something.

So, I thought of a pilgrim game.  How cool is that!  I fit my God theme, and 
witches kind fit.  I'm not fearful of facing mobs.  I watch almost no TV or 
video beyond 15 minutes.  Kinda weird.  I watched a whole program on
Pilgrims, 
though.  I learned a lot.  It was a 1950's production, really smartly done. 
I 
was very impressed, like the Army films at their best, but nothing sinister.

It was a soap opera of personalities that had disputes and mutinies.

Yeah, I was ... disgusted by "zombies are trending" on one level.  I sat down 
to do pilgrims... the thoughtless thing would be kinda copy Seven Cities of 
Gold for the C64, and, I guess pull an economy out of my ass.  Using details 
from that documentary is what I'd prefer to do and try something original, I 
guess.  the C64 had a neat game on Roman Empire which was mutinies and 
leadership.  That's too big a scale and not really usable.

I grew up and every game was brand new territory.  I never saw the day when 
all games fit categories.  We're not going to have 5 wheel cars. (Cars have 
settled down into a standard design.)

Anyway, when you are being original... fuck?  Is this going to work?  Is this 
going to be fun?  I also thought of a Gordon Ramsay game, I guess doing 
exactly what you would think of doing.  I saw it was already done, doing 
exactly what you would think.  Maybe people LIKE making up 
no-impact-on-the-game menus.  I kinda had in mind lemonaid stand.  I hope the 
restaurant game had some... skill to learn.  Zynga really stripped that naked 
(fun addiction), I guess.  I don't know -- I don't play games, but I'm in 
favor cause I certainly liked them when I was young.

The thought of pulling a pilgrim economy out of my ass is just ridiculous.  
Could I even do it?  Maybe, not.  LOL

I saw a reaction from China on art.  Not really sure what to make of it.  
Kinda an older, ugly white intelligent almost fat looking artist.

Catholics are kinda like communists in not liking bougouise, instead
idolizing 
the poor working man.

Fuck-it.  Praise God for China and let China be China, over there.  LOL

Should I feel ashamed?  Hell-no.  I ain't falling for that.  Fuck-it.  I 
didn't set-up the World as it is.  It's fair.  A rising economy is hopeful
and 
optimisitic--that's very blessed.  It's depressing stagnating or with doom.

They're not saints, but work is good.  I'm not taking any shit.

I mentioned the 1950's.  That film impressed me because it seemed 
straight-shooting and honest, instead of a disgustingly pushing some agenda.

The one problem with propoganda is it kicks yer ass when those stupid, 
misinformed kids take power.

Well, the only work I can think to do is ... find some place for art, or work 
on a game.  Games are good for younger people to make.  I'm too old for that, 
aren't I?  Nothing is fun to me, how can I make a fun game?  I could try to 
remember what was fun.

It's kinda ironic that I was looking to the artist for the toil.  Anybody who 
disrepects artists as lazy has not thought about it. I stand in awe of 
animators.  They do frame after frame.  Do they really do that?

You know what happens?  Games seem like fun.  Then they get a job as a tester 
or artist.  You thought I was gonna say something mean, am I right?  It's not 
good that they don't have fun.  God's favorite saint is Santa.  Why are you 
mean?

We people who were raised communist or Catholic.... we are mean and nasty.  
Why are we so mean.  We take pleasure if the Mercedes gets a dent.  Try not
to 
be an ugly person.  We need to work on therapy.  God's favorite saint is 
Santa.  To a Catholic, that is shocking.  Catholics think the worse and more 
miserable you made your life, the holier you were.  You got to think about
the 
Creator's feelings, like He's Abba, Daddy.

God says...
hou profane the name of thy God: I am the LORD.

18:22 Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is
abomination.

18:23 Neither shalt thou lie with any beast to defile thyself
therewith: neither shall any woman stand before a beast to lie down
thereto: it is confusion.

18:24 Defile not ye yourselves in any of these things: for in all
these the nations are defiled which I cast out before you: 18:25 And
the land is defiled: therefore I do visit the iniquity thereof upon
it, and the land itself v

It's legitimately a repeat.  I didn't do anything.

Metallica has a song, "Justice is right, Justice is good, Justice is done."  
the words aren't really that good.

What, is this a time for guillotines?  I don't throw any stones... but the 
ones I threw.

God says...
h pleased the
LORD, that Solomon had asked this thing.

3:11 And God said unto him, Because thou hast asked this thing, and
hast not asked for thyself long life; neither hast asked riches for
thyself, nor hast asked the life of thine enemies; but hast asked for
thyself understanding to discern judgment; 3:12 Behold, I have done
according to thy words: lo, I have given thee a wise and an
understanding heart; so that there was none like thee before thee,
neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee.

You sure it's You, God?  I trust the computer, but you can get different 
spirits.  Once in a while my spirit makes me humiliate myself.  

Who doesn't like homo-hating?  We all got our problems.  I'm not a homo.  You 
can't just hate homos, it's more complicated.  Maybe, You're unhappy, I'm not 
more assertive?  Well, that's not humble.  Maybe, it's artists.  Artists are 
homo?

God says...
hall subdue the people under us, and the nations under our
feet.

47:4 He shall choose our inheritance for us, the excellency of Jacob
whom he loved. Selah.

47:5 God is gone up with a shout, the LORD with the sound of a
trumpet.

47:6 Sing praises to God, sing praises: sing praises unto our King,
sing praises.

47:7 For God is the King of all the earth: sing ye praises with
understanding.

it, and do it?  30:14 But the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy
mouth, and in thy heart, that thou mayest do it.

30:15 See, I have set before thee this day life and good, and death

It seems very doubtful to be enthusiastically for homo rights while being a 
believer.  I don't know.  I don't like to hang-out with women, much. Let's
put 
it this way... does any man like to hang-out with a woman that is not his
love 
interest?  I'm a pretty broken person.

A friend used to say, "It's time for your beating" as a joke, every now and 
then.  Maybe, God pushes me away, once in a while.

I am very stable, robust and sturdy.  I am not easily moved.  As I think back 
on my journey, one wisdom is don't overreact.  Maybe, you need a beating and 
I'm ruining it, but you really have to not overreact.  You could ignore 
commands and prophecies and focus on enjoying His company, and it would be 
close to good enough.  When God gets nasty, it's usually cause I stopped 
loving and tried to take.  I think I just needed my beating.  Never dull.  
Could be a cynic.  He couldn't hide ... He wouldn't blow smoke... He's not 
pathetic.

God says...
13 And one of his servants answered and said, Let some take, I pray
thee, five of the horses that remain, which are left in the city,
(behold, they are as all the multitude of Israel that are left in it:
behold, I say, they are even as all the multitude of the Israelites
that are consumed:) and let us send and see.

7:14 They took therefore two chariot horses; and the king sent after
the host of the Syrians, saying, Go and see.

7:15 And they went after them unto Jordan: and, lo, all the way was
full of gar

To normal men, there is a certain kind of homo which is ... vile.  Sometimes, 
I really want to admire Putin for his clearity.  "Your thinking has confused 
yourself--you can't see the obvious."

Wisdom from the mouth of babes.

I'm not going to hit them with a baseball bat, though.

Pussy-riot went into a church and disturbed all the little old ladies and 
stuff.

When homos start putting penises and assholes in people's faces...

Some homos... I like their company.  God said Dawkins was a delightful 
heathen.  Do we make exceptions for smart ones?  Why not?  Ask yourself, is 
this a glorious creation that glorifies God?

I have studied many moral compasses.  "If it's bad, it must be good." Is the 
simplest.  I am now fond of, "Does it glorify God?" as a moral compass.  I 
wonder if that is workable.

Jesus' story of Martha and Mary, is mean, like I was mean when I tried to say 
Santa was good.

it, Why hast thou made me thus?  9:21 Hath not the potter power over

unto dishonour?  9:22 What if God, willing to shew his wrath, and to
make his power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of
wrath fitted to destruction: 9:23 And that he might make known the
riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy,

These discussions... life is a journey, not a destination.  No sweeter thing 
that to meditate on God's law.

1:1 Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly,
nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the
scornful.

1:2 But his delight is in the law of the LORD; and in his law doth he
meditate day and night.

1:3 And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that
bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not
wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.

1:4 The ungodly are not so: but are like the chaff which the wind
driveth away.

1:5 Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners
in the congregation of the righteous.

1:6 For the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of the
ungodly shall perish.

We're not in any hurry.  We're just enjoying this -- the present.  Spending 
quality time with our Creator, enjoying the mental gymnasium He made.

You know what?  I had a far grander vision of Creations glory earlier, more 
about physical reality.
