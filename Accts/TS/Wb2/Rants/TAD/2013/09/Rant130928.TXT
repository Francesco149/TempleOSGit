In terms of what purpose it is built for, the vision for Linux is a
multi-user 
mainframe, with full protections against crashing.  The vision for TempleOS
is 
a modern Commodore 64.  That is, I made TempleOS to serve the same niche as a 
Commodore 64.

The C64 came with a manual full of BASIC programs that told how to make
binary 
sprite DATA statements in a BASIC program.

TempleOS identity-maps memory.  Memory will fragment.  It is a kayak, not a 
Titanic.  Just reboot.  Making a complete back-up is simple.  Just reinstall.
 
Do a few fire drills, so it is second nature, and you will have amazing peace 
of mind.

10:5 There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, as an error
which proceedeth from the ruler: 10:6 Folly is set in great dignity,
and the rich sit in low place.

10:7 I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking as servants
upon the earth.

10:8 He that diggeth a pit shall fall into it; and whoso breaketh an
hedge, a serpent shall bite him.

10:9 Whoso removeth stones shall be hurt therewith; and he that
cleaveth wood shall be endangered thereby.

10:10 If the iron be blunt, and he do not whet the edge, then must he
put to more strength: but wisdom is profitable to direct.

10:11 Surely the serpent will bite without enchantment; and a babbler
is no better.

10:12 The words of a wise man's mouth are gracious; but the lips of a
fool will swallow up himself.

10:13 The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness: and the
end of his talk is mischievous madness.

10:14 A fool also is full of words: a man cannot tell what shall be;
and what shall be after him, who can tell him?  10:15 The labour of
the foolish wearieth every one of them, because he knoweth not how to
go to the city.
