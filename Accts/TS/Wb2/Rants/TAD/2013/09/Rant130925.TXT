So, most people think of SHA and security when they hear "hash".  If you have 
a command-line with 200 commands, you can use a hash for high-speed look-up.

Make an array of 1024 linked-list-heads, fill them with NULL, then add-up the 
ASCII of the command names and place them in the table.  The sum of letters
is 
a hash.  A better hash is sum with a bit shift.

So, I have 3 redundant techniques for dealing with imports in my kernel 
module.  I use function-pointers, I use HolyC function imports and I have an 
array called [C:/Kernel/Adam1b.HPP.Z,281] ext[] with function pointers that
can be called from ASM.  The 
function-pointers can be check for NULL and not-called.  I am thinking of 
making HolyC imports call an empty function if used before they are defined.  
I can point them to an empty function, when I get around to it.

I changed the initial value of Binary File Imports.  A CALL instruction to 
call an import used to have the self-address already subtracted in its 
position so the import address was added.  Now, I clobber the old CALL 
instruction's offest completely.

God's temple must be perfect.  Someone says the PC is dead.  There are people 
who wish it dead.  What do You think, God?

God says...

7:11 And he called the porters; and they told it to the king's house

7:12 And the king arose in the night, and said unto his servants, I
will now shew you what the Syrians have done to us. They know that we
be hungry; therefore are they gone out of the camp to hide themselves
in the field, saying, When they come out of the city, we shall catch
them alive, and get into the city.

7:13 And one of his servants answered and said, Let some take, I pray
thee, five of the horses that remain,

I feel very happy -- all the stuff I cleaned-up.

You think I should go to the nurse, tomorrow, God?

I stumbled onto Gordon Ramsay videos.  I watched them all.  It's a world far 
from computer nerds.  I find it interesting and wholesome.  I like to imagine 
eating the foods, strangely satisfying.

I'm impressed Gordon started a new life after an injury at age 23.  Pride 
before a fall, humility before honors.

Jacob, in the Bible was a cook.

[C:/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,76684] Malachi,1:1 demanded unblemished offerings for
God's temple.

I thought Gordon Ramsay might be a good CEO for God's temple.

If you've ever polished a turd, you know it's difficult.  Anything that looks 
perfect, took a whole lot of polishing.

McDonalds hires people to make photos for ads and they use fake food.  A
three 
star chef makes real food look good!  He has the eye for class that Steve
Jobs 
had and he's a hundred times more charasmatic than Balmer.  He's smart, too.

He did Christmas specials.  I think he's a Christian.

God says...

to the time appointed: and there died of the people from Dan even to
Beersheba seventy thousand men.

24:16 And when the angel stretched out his hand upon Jerusalem to
destroy it, the LORD repented him of the evil, and said to the angel
that destroyed the people, It is enough: stay now thine hand. And the
angel of the LORD was by the threshingplace of Araunah the Jebusite.

24:17 And David spake unto the LORD when he saw the angel that smote

That was a dud.  They're never prophetic.  It might be about 70,000 lines of 
code.  One time, I think He said 58,000 was how many He wanted.  It's about 
98,000 but you could leave stuff out.

Maybe, Gordon is an angel.  From one person's viewpoint a person can seem
like 
an angel.  I catch myself saying unintended things, that I don't realize.

Dud.

I need to do videos.  Gordon is an expert at making videos, if nothing else!  
I wonder how many takes he does.  I think I'm pretty lazy because two takes 
seems like a lot of work, LOL.

You know what?  I write songs for an hour now and then.  When I think about 
doing songs for 40 hours a week, it boggles my mind what I could do.  It
makes 
me think about all the different professionals in the world.  It's possible 
that Gordon does 6 takes on his videos.  A professional would do that.

God says...
 good land which the LORD your God hath given you.

23:14 And, behold, this day I am going the way of all the earth: and
ye know in all your hearts and in all your souls, that not one thing
hath failed of all the good things which the LORD your God spake
concerning you; all are come to pass unto you, and not one thing hath
failed thereof.

23:15 Therefore it shall come to pass, that as all good things are
come upon you, which the LORD your God promised you; so shall the LORD
bring upon you all evil things,

Dud.  Might be a joke -- if you ignore bad prophecy, you have to also ignore 
good.  LOL  Try to get a sense of God's personality -- He's not boring, He's
a 
character.

Cooking and baby elephants are delightfully in-the-light.  The radio talked 
about an atom bomb.  That's dark.  LOL.  I have suffered much torment and 
learned to stay in-the-light, or suffer terror.  I make an effort to stay 
in-the-light, but don't mind slipping into dark.  Dark is what we crave and 
move toward naturally.  You have to make an effort to stay in-the-light.  
Evolution is dark.  War is dark.

Japan really tries to stay in-the-light as penance.  God bless them.  Staying 
in the light can be happy happy joy joy.

Anyway, I like cooking.  I like to praise God for stuff and I ran out of 
animals.  I can praise Him for all the foods!  I like coconuts.  I think 
they're really neat.  All the foods are neat.

So... I praise God for animals and foods.  LOL

dud.

You know?  To love God you have to enjoy evil.  LOL.  God wants to crush your 
enemies.  What do you say if God crushes your enemies.  You're probably too 
scared to love evil, but you insult God.  Don't be proud of heart.  Proud of 
heart is not accepting a gift, from God!  When you begin to have real love
for 
God, you'll see the real God is more lovable than the Catholic God.  God said 
war was "servicemen competing."  That shows He's real and lovable, for real.

I've heard it said that nobody likes celebrities that are too perfect.  I'm 
not sure that's true or not.  God doesn't only want bad stuff for you, some 
honest-to-good good stuff!

God says...

8:22 While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and

fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.

9:2 And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast
of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth
upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are
they delivered.

I sit there an think about all the wonderful foods in Gordon's videos.

I asked Jesus if He liked mustard a lot.  "Bad meat happeneth"

I wonder what Gordon thinks of A1 steak sauce.

I guess sauce insults cooks.

God really freaked-out and got angry about rare meat.  God really does not 
like eating blood.  Chefs like to make it as rare as possible.  God does not 
like that.

2:5 And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of
every nation under heaven.

2:6 Now when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and
were confounded, because that every man heard them speak in his own

They say the public really doesn't want to see sausage or laws being made.

I saw Gordon make sausage.  Praise God that He made those neat little 
ready-to-use edible tubes, just right for sausage...  And they plunk!

So, I made a compiler+assembler.  When I'm working on it, I behave really 
dangerously, though, nothing bad can really happen.  The worst that could 
happen would be me compiling my disk code and the compiler making a bug that 
corrupted my disk.  It has happened once or twice.

I change my compiler and think nothing of turning-it loose on all my code.  
It's just the fastest way to develop it.  I change it make it LIVE! In action 
on all my code!

Two things can happen -- the compiler can crash as it compiles or it can make 
bad code that crashes.

I get risky until I get burned and make a bad mistake, then I get
conservative 
for a while.  I try to do testing.  I don't test everything.  There are just 
too many cases.  I'm a good boy because I made a big automated test suite, at 
least.

My operating system is pretty solid, but I stay within habits.

One time, probably 5 years into my compiler, I was totally shocked to discover

if (i<5) puts("Hello"); //This worked.

if (5>i) puts("Hello"); //This made bad code!

I just never do yoda conditionals, so I never noticed.  In a nutshell, I know 
there are lots of bugs to uncover if people try perfectly reasonable stuff, 
that I just never do.  I try not to press my luck multitasking.  If I'm in
the 
middle of something, the last thing I want is to corrupt the disk, so I don't 
risk doing multitatsking-type stuff when running scripts, for example.  It's 
somewhat safe, but there are lots of KNOWN and INTENDED dangers you can 
stumble upon, like deleting a directory while someone is in it.  Don't do 
that, moron!  (It's easy to forget something like that.)

God says...
t: and God doeth it, that
men should fear before him.

3:15 That which hath been is now; and that which is to be hath already
been; and God requireth that which is past.

3:16 And moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment, that
wickedness was there; and the place of righteousness, that iniquity
was there.

3:17 I said in mine heart, God shall judge the righteous and the
wicked: for there is a time there for every purpose and for every
work.

3:18 I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the so

----09/25/13 23:59:48----

This is fascinating.

if (i<5) puts("Hello"); //This worked.

if (5>i) puts("Hello"); //This made bad code!

What happened was, I flipped a conditional to put the immediate second but I 
made the mistake of doing a NOT on the conditional after flipping it.

I took:

(5>i)

and made it into

(i<=5)

that is not right!

It reminds me.  Isn't that weird how multiplying by -1 in algebra flips a 
conditional.  I'm actually rusty.  It flips it, right?

God says...

I have not strawed: 25:27 Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money
to the exchangers, and then at my coming I should have received mine
own with usury.

hath ten talents.

25:29 For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have
abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that
which he hath.

25:30 And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer dark
