2) God doesn't and I live, more or less, content in this delusion for the

Anyway, in 1993 when the 486 was kinda new and I had worked on Ticketamster's 
VAX 32-bit system, I got interested and made a DOS program to change to
32-bit 
mode.  I set it aside.  In 2003 when I got excited about 64-bit coming out, I 
resurrected it.

I thought, "I will brutally take advantage of the crippling legacy weakness
of 
Microsoft and Linux by being pure 64-bit."  So, I kinda couldn't get a 64-bit 
machine as soon as I hoped.  I planned for it while on a 32-bit machine,
doing 
a half-ass emulated 64-bit on 32-bit compiler.  I made a slow, temporary 
64-bit MUL and DIV software interrupt and I made my compiler use just two 
64-bit regs - EAX:EDX EBC:ECX, doing everything with 64-bit sized operations, 
but planning ahead.  terrible performance, obviously, but I soon went from
two 
64-bit regs and emulated math to sixteen 64-bit regs!  I got it 64-bit by 
2007.

The song, While My Guitar Gently Weeps, has a line, "You were inverted."

There's a famous Christmas story.  A men sells his watch to buy a hair band.  
A women cuts her hair and sells it to a wig person to buy a chain for a watch.

In my Bible, I read, "It is love that I desire, not sacrifice. Knowledge of 
God, not holocaust."  My head exploded.  I thought love WAS sacrifice.  There 
is no greater love than to lay down your life.  Christ loved us.

I was so confused, I literally looked-up the word, "Love" in the dictionary.  
"To take delight in."  Holy Shit!  I realized, it wasn't love -- it was pride 
-- proud of heart -- who can sacrifice the mostest?  The one who suffers most 
is the most love.  Inverted!  What does God think when He looks at you trying 
to hurt yourself because you love Him?  Does He feel good?  Santa is His 
favorite saint.  He likes Beverly Hillbillies because oil is a gift from God 
-- God is the hero.  God loved Jacob and hated Esau.  Esau gave-up his 
birthright.

Do not give away a gift from God because you are too proud to enjoy it.

Jesus was humble of heart.  Read the Bible, now that you know what proud of 
heart means.

God says...
44:11 Yet they shall be ministers in my sanctuary, having charge at
the gates of the house, and ministering to the house: they shall slay
the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people, and they shall
stand before them to minister unto them.

44:12 Because they ministered unto them before their idols, and caused
the house of Israel to fall into iniquity; therefore have I lifted up
mine hand against them, saith the Lord GOD, and they shall bear their
iniquity.

44:13 And they shall not come near unto me

Ask a Catholic to praise God...
"Thank you for family and for food and..."
I said "Praise" not "Thank".

Guess what?  God is so pathetic He cares that we praise Him.

"Omni" "infinity" crap is yeast of the pharasees.  You will think God so 
great, you cannot even imagine Him... and you will behave really retarded.

Say your prayers out loud -- He ain't got time to mess with reading your 
spaghetti brain!  (Yes, effort is work for God -- neighbor knocking in night 
is what prayer requests are like.)

"Abba"

God says...
prevail
against thee; for I am with thee, saith the LORD, to deliver thee.

2:1 Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying, 2:2 Go and cry
in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith the LORD; I remember
thee, the kindness of thy youth, the love of thine espousals, when
thou wentest after me in the wilderness, in a land that was not sown.

2:3 Israel was holiness unto the LORD, and the firstfruits of his
increase: all that devour him shall offend; evil shall come upon them,
saith the LORD.

2:4 Hear

Saw a guy complaining about a bad compiler and talking about Turing.

LOL

I took 5 asm courses

CSC226
CSC326
CSE421
CSE422
CSE523

You guys learned about P=NP

I am a system's programmer.  I took a compiler course and an operating system 
course.

You fucken don't know assembly!  How dare you, what a fucken joke!  You could 
just use my handy Unassembler function and judge for yourself.  My compiler's 
assembly is respectible.

C is more or less mapped one-to-one onto assembly, but compilers try very
hard 
to fix bad C.  Basically, they get really arrogant at how extrememly bad the
C 
they can fix, is.

God says...

14:14 The backslider in heart shall be filled with his own ways: and a
good man shall be satisfied from himself.

14:15 The simple believeth every word: but the prudent man looketh
well to his going.

14:16 A wise man feareth, and departeth from evil: but the fool
rageth, and is confident.

14:17 He that is soon angry dealeth foolishly: and a man of wicked
devices is hated.

14:18 The simple inherit folly: but the prudent are crowned with
knowledge.

14:19 The evil bow before the good; and the wicked

BBC is talking about Iraq War.  Sad.  It's more confusing when you believe in 
God than when you are an atheist.

God says...
fore your God: I am the LORD
your God.

10:11 And it came to pass on the twentieth day of the second month, in
the second year, that the cloud was taken up from off the tabernacle
of the testimony.

10:12 And the children of Israel took their journeys out of the
wilderness of Sinai; and the cloud rested in the wilderness of Paran.

10:13 And they first took their journey according to the commandment
of the LORD by the hand of Moses.

10:14 In the first place went the standard of the camp of the children

22:24 And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah,

23:1 And Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old: these
were the years of the life of Sarah.

23:2 And Sarah died in Kirjatharba; the same is Hebron in the land of
Canaan: and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her.

23:3 And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spake unto the
sons of Heth, saying, 23:4 I am a stranger and a sojourner with you:

I guess I should say when I get a dud.  That was a dud.  I think the previous 
was a dud.  I view them like I might view paintings in a museum.  "This 
doesn't do much for me, but maybe other people like it."  I just move-on.  
Treat it like art in a museum.  Enjoy God's company and get to know Him.

The purpose of life is to know God, love God and obey God.

The complier and operating system are real -- fucken posted all the code and 
you can download the ISO, it's really frustrating when I do so much to prove 
it.

I thought we had moved past the clowns who thought the brain could do 400Mhz.
