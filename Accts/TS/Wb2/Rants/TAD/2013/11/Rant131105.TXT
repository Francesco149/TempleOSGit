they conferred among themselves, 4:16 Saying, What shall we do to
these men? for that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them is
manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny it.

4:17 But that it spread no further among the people, let us straitly
threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no man in this name.

4:18 And they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor
teach in the name of Jesus.

right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God,

The Book of Daniel


1:1 In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged it.

1:2 And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part
of the vessels of the house of God: which he carried into the land of
Shinar to the house of his god; and he brought the vessels into the
treasure house of his god.

1:3 And the king spake unto Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that
he should bring certain of the children of Israel, and of the king's
seed, and of the princes; 1:4 Children in whom was no blemish, but
well favoured, and skilful in all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge,
and understanding science, and such as had ability in them to stand in
the king's palace, and whom they might teach the learning and the
tongue of the Chaldeans.

The concept of a file system path is not relevant.  Basically, a PATH is a
way 
of joining many directories.  There is no need for that.  In Unix and DOS, 
when you type a command, you expect it to search the PATH for a filename.  
That type of thing does not happen.  Instead, you interact with a JIT HolyC 
compiler and call function names already in Adam's symbol table.  "Dir;" will 
search your hash table, not find it and search parents.  Adam is a parent. 
Adam has a function "Dir".  It then compiles a call to Dir; and executes it.

Do this: Get someone to explain how a C64 worked.  Typing "Dir;" at the 
command-line is like typeing "GOSUB 1000" at the C64 command-line.  It calls 
code sitting in memory.

You could make so #include "" at the command-line searched all directories in 
a PATH, but that is a useless complexity we can save money on, or in this
case 
brain confusion.  We live for being new and simpler.  No PATH.

You are just stubbornly a retarded nigger that can't think outside boxes.  I 
fucken hate people who pretend Linux is the only way, like a C64 never 
existed.  They talk like that's the only way things can be done and I just 
stare at them like they are a fucken cow that needs to be beat over the head, 
but that doesn't help.  I have tried to explain things to my little brother.

Genius niggers invented SMP.

Any nigger can make shit complicated.  These fucken nigger respect the most 
complicated cause it must be smart.


My vision was a C64, not a main frame.

You niggers want to run two video game at one time.

I did not do InvaldiateRect because I am not a monkey-see-monkey do nigger
who 
copies others and gets caught with their errs.  Invalidate rect is counter 
productive in a full-screen flight simulator.  You niggers didn't realize 
that!

The osdev niggers can't even do algebra, yet they talk arrogantly.

I wrote this for filling a triange.  How you think you do it!
[C:/Adam/Gr/GrPrimatives.CPP.Z,1131] GrFillTri0()

Algebra can be an IQ test.  Carmack can do algebra, but not a single one of 
the niggers at OSDev.

Nigger!

I called my bootloader CDBoot at one point.

Fucker is accusing me of stealing it.

I am a white person.  I can write a bootloader.

Guess what?  In 1990, Ticketmaster hired me and one thing I did was VMap.  25 
years ago I wrote a tool to go through the Ticketamster filesystem and verify 
the allocation map, just like DOS Checkdisk.  At age 20, I did that.  That
was 
25 years ago.  In 1992, I wrote an archive compression utility for VAX and 
x86, that used LZW compression and bundled directory trees into a single zip 
file with bloom filters and encryption and fletcher's checksum. 23 years ago.

I am not a nigger.  I can write programs like boot loaders.  That's nothing 
for me.  I fucken wrote my compiler!  The problem is you don't realize you
are 
an inferior species.  That's the problem.  You are a nigger and think I am a 
nigger like you.

God says...
100:1 Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all ye lands.

100:2 Serve the LORD with gladness: come before his presence with
singing.

100:3 Know ye that the LORD he is God: it is he that hath made us, and
not we ourselves; we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.

100:4 Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with
praise: be thankful unto him, and bless his name.

100:5 For the LORD is good; his mercy is everlasting; and his truth
endureth to all generations.



101:1 I will sing of mercy and judgment: unto thee, O LORD, will I
sing.

All the democrats are atheists.  They just passed a gay-rights bill.  People 
who believe in God don't do stuff like that, even if God tells them.  A 
believer in God just does not promote gay rights.

All Hell's gonna break loose when God is public.

God says...
in the field; for upon every man and beast which shall be found in the
field, and shall not be brought home, the hail shall come down upon
them, and they shall die.

9:20 He that feared the word of the LORD among the servants of Pharaoh
made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses: 9:21 And he
that regarded not the word of the LORD left his servants and his
cattle in the field.

9:22 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch forth thine hand toward
heaven, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, upon man, and
upon beast, and upon every herb of the field, throughout the land of
Egypt.

9:23 And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven: and the LORD
sent thunder and hail, and the fire ran along upon the ground; and the
LORD rained hail upon the land of Egypt.

9:24 So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous,
such as there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it
