Hell Freezes Over

                                   Demands

When God is manifest to the World and He claims this operating system, 
publically, here's what I want:

1) VMware to again support PC Speaker and provide emulation if no PC Speaker 
is present.

2) Windows and Linux support RedSea file system in place of FAT32 and
ISO9660. 
 Then, I can remove FAT32 and ISO9660.  (About 2,000 lines of blemished
code.) 
 

3) Windows to burn ISO files to CD/DVD-ROMS.  USB memory sticks are not an 
option, so CD/DVD is what we use.

4) No secure boot.  TempleOS is a additional operating system that must be 
used along-side Windows or Linux.  It must dual boot.

5) Mandate to PC manufacturers that ATA/ATAPI PIO must work.

6) PS2 emulated Keyboard and Mouse must work.  The BIOS must enable these.

7) VMware should allow ATAPI to connect real CD/DVD hardware.

8) Perhaps, VMware can enable faster than standard x86 IN/OUT instruction 
timing for ATA/ATAPI PIO, so the bandwidth isn't as bad.

9) VMware and others should list TempleOS as one of the 64-bit operating 
systems.

10) Windows and Linux should support TempleOS .GRA graphics files.  These are 
just right-side-up .BMP files with 8-bit pixs 4-bits of color and 
transparency, with no palette.  Compression comes from the RedSea .Z LZW 
compression.  (Let me know when you want it.)

In other words, all hardware and BIOSes must support TempleOS as a native and 
as a virtual system, dual booted with Windows or Linux.

It would be neat if TempleOS were burned into BIOS ROMs.  My hope is that it 
will be finished and largely unchanging.  I need a good dictionary, first.  
Maybe, we leave the dictionary out.

I do not intend to ever support UEFI.  That monstrocity uses elf and various 
propriatary graphics formats.

I need to finalize RedSea and GRA, before you implement them.  (Minor 
changes.)
