11:14 And when she looked, behold, the king stood by a pillar, as the

from bringing.

36:7 For the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make
it, and too much.

36:8 And every wise hearted man among them that wrought the work of
the tabernacle made ten curtains of fine twined linen, and blue, and
purple, and scarlet: with cherubims of cunning work made he them.

36:9 The length of one curtain was twenty and eight cubits, and the
breadth of one curtain four cubits: the curtains were all of one size.

36:10 And he coupled the five curtains one unto another: and the other
five curtains he coupled one unto another.

36:11 And he made loops of blue on the edge of one curtain from the
selvedge in the coupling: likewise he made in the uttermost side of
another curtain, in the coupling of the second.

I have kind-of a shameful thing to confess.  In 2002, I got a high paying
job. 
 I bought a bunch of stuff for my new appartment, like bathroom curtain clips 
at Target.  My Mom gifted me with used dishes and used bed sheets and other 
stuff I wasn't thrilled about -- would have preferred to buy them new.

trouble thee this day. And all Israel stoned him with stones, and
burned them with fire, after they had stoned them with stones.

breadth of every side chamber, four cubits, round about the house on
every side.

41:6 And the side chambers were three, one over another, and thirty in
order; and they entered into the wall which was of the house for the
side chambers round about, that they might have hold, but they had not
hold in the wall of the house.

41:7 And there was an enlarging, and a winding about still upward to
the side chambers: for the winding about of the house went still
upward round about the house: therefore the breadth of the house was
still upward, and so increased from the lowest chamber to the highest

41:8 I saw also the height of the house round about: the foundations
of the side chambers were a full reed of six great cubits.

feast of the passover, and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified.

26:3 Then assembled together the chief priests, and the scribes, and
the elders of the people, unto the palace of the high priest, who was
called Caiaphas, 26:4 And consulted that they might take Jesus by
subtilty, and kill him.

26:5 But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar
among the people.

26:6 Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,

precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat at meat.

what purpose is this waste?  26:9 For this ointment might have been
sold for much, and given to the poor.
