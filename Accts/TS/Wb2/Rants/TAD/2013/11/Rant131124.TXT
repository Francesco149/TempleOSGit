14:10 All the land shall be turned as a plain from Geba to Rimmon
south of Jerusalem: and it shall be lifted up, and inhabited in her
place, from Benjamin's gate unto the place of the first gate, unto the
corner gate, and from the tower of Hananeel unto the king's
winepresses.

14:11 And men shall dwell in it, and there shall be no more utter
destruction; but Jerusalem shall be safely inhabited.

14:12 And this shall be the plague wherewith the LORD will smite all
the people that have fought against Jerusalem; Their flesh shall
consume away while they stand upon their feet, and their eyes shall
consume away in their holes, and their tongue shall consume away in
their mouth.

14:13 And it shall come to pass in that day, that a great tumult from
the LORD shall be among them; and they shall lay hold every one on the
hand of his neighbour, and his hand shall rise up against the hand of
his neighbour.

38:21 For Isaiah had said, Let them take a lump of figs, and lay it
for a plaister upon the boil, and he shall recover.

38:22 Hezekiah also had said, What is the sign that I shall go up to
the house of the LORD?  39:1 At that time Merodachbaladan, the son of
Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah: for
he had heard that he had been sick, and was recovered.

39:2 And Hezekiah was glad of them, and shewed them the house of his
precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the
precious ointment, and all the house of his armour, and all that was
found in his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all his
dominion, that Hezekiah shewed them not.

him, What said these men? and from whence came they unto thee? And
Hezekiah said, They are come from a far country unto me, even from
Babylon.

The down-sides of identity-mapped (single address space) are obvious.  
Hopefully, you see the up-sides.  I never have to copy address spaces or 
anything.  All tasks can access all memory, no sweat.  One task doesn't have 
duplicate numbers to other tasks -- all addresses are unique.

I get a lot of confused people who enter with preconcieved notions, like

None of that is correct.

I know this is hard, but it is the usage model of a C64 that I am talking 
about.

If I have a sports car, it gets used a certain way.
If I have a work pick-up truck, it gets used a certain way.
If I have an RV, it gets used a certain way.

If I have a VAX, it gets used a certain way.
If I have a Nintendo, it gets used a certain way, same way as a XBox or 
Playstation 4.

A C64 was used like an Apple II, like Tandy.

The C64 had sprites.  People wrote BASIC programs.  That's what they did.  
They typed-in programs from magazines.  And, they played games.  My
generation 
learned how to program in assembly language, because you had to.  You could 
edit disk sectors with programs, you could POKE all the internals.


What would it be like if Linux was just a 1,000 line program?  It would be 
delightful.  Everybody would know everything there is to know about Linux.

I took 5 assembly language courses in school and have been paid to program in 
VAX assembly on Ticketmaster's operating system.  I wrote a VAX and a x86
file 
compression for TM in assembly language.  I wrote an 8051 assembly language 
firmware to control a device that used an A2D to monitor wall voltage and 
switch taps to correct wall voltage, I wrote a 68020 bar code reader RS232 
networking device and a 68020 barcode image processing assembly thing.  I did 
a 8051 stepper motor driver thing for my 3 axis milling machine, I did a PIC 
microcontroller for making a replacement chip for toner cartriges in PIC 
assembly language, I did a AVR Tiny12 assembly for a device to monitor toner 
level.

supports just enough 16 bit to boot.

Not a single computer science major is taught the concept of overengineering.
 
I was a computer systems engineer.  I did not take an algorithm class, but I 
took five assembly language courses and digital design and the engineering 
core.  I had a class, where we programmed in M6800 asm and were graded on a 
curve on how short our code was.

Guess what?  It is always going to be 100,000 lines of code.  It will never
be 
more.  It does not have to be designed to grow.  It is like a C64 ROM.  There 
will not be libraries.  Developers will bring their own libraries, in the
same 
way C64 had no market for 3rd party libraries.

It is not computing resources I am interested in, but mental load on 
programmers.  I want them to always see the light at the end of the tunnel
and 
be at home, knowing it is a limited amount of code they dwell within, that 
they can master.

Any idiot can make it complicated.  Nobody ever gets criticized for 
overengineering.  In fact, you will get praised and respected even if you 
ridiculously overengineer.  These people are full of the leavening of 
pharasees.

Denny Denker was my boss when I did the Ticketmaster Report Generator.  He
had 
me put a "cursor movement" command into it.  The way it was used was... they 
would get a list of names of customers, addresses, shows, and transactions, 
for example, and print invoices.  Often, they printed on top of 
form-stationary with blanks to be typed-in.  The report format had "cursor 
movement" commands to print into another location.

For the Ticketmaster RepGen, we had a 2 page buffer that you could move 
up-the-page on to continue printing, making another layer of text, more or 
less.

I put the report generator features into this operating system.  The cursor 
movement is useful, but I take a performamnce hit on account of it being 
allowed to move any number of lines up the page.

Here is a quick guide to HolyC, assumning you start with C/C++ knowledge.

There is policy of HolyC compilers defined in an unusual way.  If a value 
finds its way into a register, it has been promoted up to a 64-bit size.  All 
intermediate operations will take place on 64-bits.  When a value is written 
back to memory, it can be truncated.

I do not mess with math operations on any size but 64-bits.


We are currently at 83,000 lines of code.  We are free to expand up to
100,000 
lines, but it is a precious resource. (Getting rid of FAT32 and ISO9660 will 
save about 2000) For 1000 years, they will be limited to 100,000 lines of
code 
as a charter kind-of-thing.  In the future, they can migrate to other 
hardware.  God said 640x480x 4bit color was manditory.  As an exercise, draw 
an elephant in 16 colors and draw an elephant in 24-bit color.  This kind-of 
prevents an arms race.  The goal of the Temple is a place for everybody to do 
offerings.  As content creators, 16-color is less tedious for nonartists and 
artists, alike.

```
<img src="http://www.templeos.org/Wb/Accts/TS/Wb2/Elephant02.BMP" width="640"
height="472" alt="">
```

I need to graduate to the next level of artistry.  I need to stop trying to 
make it look realistic and make it have style and character.  Each different 
comic strip has a style.  The style adds value.  You do not draw a comic
strip 
hoping for realistic-looking art.  This is an additional reason God's choice 
of 16 colors looks good.  Could just say "Because He said so!"  Shat-up.

* switch statements always use a jump table.  Don't use them with cases with 
really big, sparse ranges.

* Allows ranges like "case 4...7:" in switch statements. 

* nobound_switch can be used if you know a switch statement will not exceed 
the lowest or highest case values.  It's a little faster because it doesn't 
check.

* sub_switch_start/sub_switch_end allow a new type of nested-switch control 
flow.  (Don't goto, throw exception or return out of sub_switch_start front 
porch area.)

* noreg or reg can be placed before a function local var name.  You can, 
optionally, specify a reg after the reg keyword.

* interrupt, haserrcode, public, argpop or noargpop are function flags. See 
[C:/Demo/Lectures/PageTableEntries2.CPP.Z,1].

* A nounusedwarn statement will suppress an unused var warning.

* You can have multiple member vars of a class named "pad" or "reserved", and 
it won't issue warnings. 

* Type casting is postfix.  To typecast int or F64, use
[C:/Kernel/Adam1b.HPP.Z,197] ToI64(), [C:/Kernel/Adam1b.HPP.Z,199] ToBool()
or 
[C:/Kernel/Adam1b.HPP.Z,198] ToF64(). (TempleOS follows normal C float<-->int
conversion, but sometimes you 
want to override.  These functions are better than multiplying by "1.0" to 
convert to float.) 

* A single quote can encompass multiple characters.  'ABC' is equal to 0x43424
1.

* The "`" operator raises a base to a power.

* There is no question-colon operator.

* You can use [C:/Compiler/ICLCC.CPP.Z,6] OptOn([C:/Kernel/Adam1a.HPP.Z,1469]
OPTf_WARN_PAREN) to find unnecessary parentheses in code.

* You can use [C:/Compiler/ICLCC.CPP.Z,6] OptOn([C:/Kernel/Adam1a.HPP.Z,1470]
OPTf_WARN_DUP_TYPES) to find dup local var type 
statements.

* With the #exe{} feature in your src code, you can place programs that
insert 
text into the stream of code being compiled.  See [C:/Kernel/KEnd.CPP.Z,1]
#exe {} for an example where 
the date/time and compile-time prompting for cfguration data is placed into a 
program.  [C:/Compiler/CmpMain.CPP.Z,1] StreamPrint() places text into a src
program stream following the 
conclusion of the #exe{} blk.

* No #define functions exist (I'm not a fan)

* No typedef, use class.

* No type-checking

* Can't use <> with #include, use "".

* "$" is an escape character.  Two dollar signs signify an ordinary $.  See 
[C:/Doc/Dollar.TXT.Z,1].  In asm or [C:/Doc/HolyC.TXT.Z,1] HolyC code, it
also refers to the instruction's 
addr. 

* union is more like a class, so you don't reference it with a union label 
after you define it.  Some common unions are declared in
[C:/Kernel/Adam1a.HPP.Z,12] Adam1a.HPP for 1,2,4 
and 8 byte objects.  If you place a type in front of a union declaration,
that 
is the type when used by itself.  See [C:/Demo/SubIntAccess.CPP.Z,1]. 

* class member vars can have meta data. fmtstr and fmtdata are two meta data 
types now used.  All compiler structures are saved and you can access the 
compiler's info about classes and vars.  See [C:/Demo/ClassMeta.CPP.Z,1] and  
[C:/Adam/Doc/DocPopUp.CPP.Z,301] DocFormDo().

* There is a keyword lastclass you use as a dft arg.  It is set to the class 
name of the previous arg.  See [C:/Adam/Dbg2a.CPP.Z,134] ClassRep().

* See [C:/Demo/Exceptions.CPP.Z,1].  try{} catch{} and throw are different
from C++. 
throw is a function with var ("...") args.  The values passed in throw() can 
be accessed from within a catch{} using the Fs->except_argc and Fs->except_arg
v[] vars.  Within a catch {} blk, set the var Fs->catch_except to TRUE if you 
want to terminate the search for a handler.  By convention, the first arg of e
xcept_argv[] specifies the exception type num.  A list of assigned exception 
types can be found at .  For a handler that will catch all excepts, you can 
use [C:/Kernel/Except.CPP.Z,46] PutExcept().

* A function is available similar to sizeof which provides the offset of a 
member of a class.  It's called offset.  You place the class name and member 
inside as in offset(classname.membername).  It has nothing to do with 16-bit 
code.  Both sizeof and offset only accept one level of member vars.  That is, 
you can't do sizeof(classname.membername.submembername).

* There is no continue statement.  Use goto.

* No bit field support, but there are bit access [Bit,1] library routines.

* lock{} can be used to apply asm LOCK prefixes to code for safe multicore 
read-modify-write accesses.  The code bracked with have LOCK asm prefix's 
applied to relevant instructions within.  It's a little shoddy.  See 
[C:/Demo/MultiCore/Lock.CPP.Z,1].

* There is a function called [C:/Kernel/Mem1b.CPP.Z,371] MSize() which gives
the size of an object 
allocated off the heap.  For larger size allocations, the system rounds-up to 
a power of two, so MSize() lets you know the real size and you can take full 
advantage of it.

* You can [C:/Kernel/Mem1b.CPP.Z,370] Free() a NULL ptr.  Useful variants of
[C:/Kernel/Mem1b.CPP.Z,376] MAlloc() can be found [C:/Kernel/Mem1b.CPP.Z,383]
Here.  
Each task has a heap and you can MAlloc and Free off of other task's heaps,
or 
make an independent heap with [C:/Kernel/Mem1c.CPP.Z,42] HeapCtrlBPInit().

* The stk does not grow because virtual mem is not used.  I recommend 
allocating large local vars from the heap.  You can change
[C:/Kernel/Adam1a.HPP.Z,2584] DFT_STK and 
recompile Kernel or request more when doing a [C:/Kernel/Task1a.CPP.Z,225]
Spawn().  You can use 
[C:/Kernel/Task1a.CPP.Z,89] CallStkGrow(), but it's odd.  See
[C:/Demo/StkGrow.CPP.Z,1]. 

* Only one base class is allowed.

* All values are extended to 64-bit when accessed.  Intermediate calculations 
are done with 64-bit values.

  The follow examples should be inserted in a function, so that reg variables 
are used.  (Global vars are never reg.)

I16 i;
I32 j;
j=i=0x12345678; //Resulting i is 0x5678 but j is 0x12345678

I64 i=0x8000000000000000;
Print("%X\n",i>>1);  //Result is 0xC000000000000000 as expected

U64 u=0x8000000000000000;
Print("%X\n",u>>1);  //Result is 0x4000000000000000 as expected

I32 i= 0x80000000;   //const is loaded into a 64-bit reg var.
Print("%X\n",i>>1);  //Result is 0x40000000

I32 i=-0x80000000;
Print("%X\n",i>>1);  //Result is 0xC0000000 as expected

[C:/Kernel/StrPrint.CPP.Z,954] MPrint() is like
[C:/Kernel/StrPrint.CPP.Z,932] SPrint() but it returns a
[C:/Kernel/Mem1b.CPP.Z,376] MAllocated str.  It is vary handy 
because you don't have to worry about overflow.

[C:/Kernel/SrvCmd.CPP.Z,491] Auto(U8 *fmt,...) sends text to the current
task's input buffer.
[C:/Kernel/SrvCmd.CPP.Z,472] AutoStr(U8 *fmt,...) sends text of an
[C:/Doc/Glossary.TXT.Z,1] AutoFile to the keyboard stream of the 
current TASK but can also do mouse cmds.

[C:/Kernel/SrvCmd.CPP.Z,451] XTalk(CTask *task,U8 *fmt,...) and text to
another task's input buffer.
[C:/Kernel/SrvCmd.CPP.Z,501] XTalkStr(CTask *task,U8 *fmt,...) sends text of
an [C:/Doc/Glossary.TXT.Z,1] AutoFile to the keyboard 
stream of another TASK but can also do mouse cmds.

[C:/Adam/Doc/DocPlain.CPP.Z,679] DocPrint(CDoc *doc,U8 *fmt,...) sends text
to a document.  You can buffer to a 
Doc and save it, providing the functionality of fprintf.  See 
[C:/Demo/Dsk/FPrintF.CPP.Z,1].

[C:/Kernel/SrvCmd.CPP.Z,404] Adam(U8 *fmt,...) sends text to the adam task to
be compiled and run.
[C:/Kernel/SrvCmd.CPP.Z,425] AdamLog(U8 *fmt,...) and
[C:/Kernel/SrvCmd.CPP.Z,437] AdamErr(U8 *fmt,...) send text to the adam task
to be 
displayed.

[C:/Compiler/CmpMain.CPP.Z,1] StreamPrint(U8 *fmt,...) sends text to the
stream of code being compiled and 
must reside in a #exe{} blk.

[C:/Adam/Gr/GrBitMap.CPP.Z,866] GrPrint(CDC *dc,I64 x,I64 y,U8 *fmt,...) and
[C:/Adam/Gr/GrBitMap.CPP.Z,875] GrVPrint() plots text in graphics 
mode.

[C:/Compiler/CmpMain.CPP.Z,640] ExePrint(U8 *fmt,...) compiles and execute a
string.  Note: It returns the 
result of the last executed expression.

[C:/Adam/AutoFile2a.CPP.Z,28] AFPrint(I64 mS,U8 *fmt)
[C:/Kernel/Display.CPP.Z,199] PutChars()s one at a time with a delay.

[C:/Kernel/Dbg1a.CPP.Z,222] RawPrint(I64 mS,U8 *fmt) sends direct to screen
memory, bypassing window 
manager.

**Note:** Use Print("%s",src) if you need an unmodified string.


The [C:/Kernel/StrPrint.CPP.Z,946] Print() family supports extended format
codes.  See [C:/Kernel/StrPrint.CPP.Z,247] SPrintJoin().
  %[-][0][width][.decimals][flags][hsub_fmt][main_fmt]

flags:
    * 't' is a flag which will truncate to field width.
* ',' is a flag which will add commas every three digits in a %d, %f, %g, 
%e and %n entries.
* '$' is a flag which affects the %Q entry, converting '$' to "\044".
* '/' is a flag which affects the %Q and %q entries, converting '%' to "%%
".
* 'k' is a flag which forces 1000 instead of 1024 on integer with sub_fmts
.
  
sub_fmt:
    For "%n", "%d" or "%u", the sub_fmt causes thousands mode.  "%h?n" will 
pick a var exponent multiples of three unit, while "%h-3n" will display 
milli units or "%h6n" will display mega units.  The 'k' flag is always on 
for "%n".  See [C:/Demo/Print.CPP.Z,1].
  
*  "%n" will print a floating point in engineering notation, exponents being 
multiples of three.  If it has a sub_fmt code, it will display scientific 
units letters.

* "%S" will print a Define entry.

* "%C" will print a ToUpper character.

* "%F" will print a text file.

* "%P" will display a PSECT expression which is good for ptrs or addresses.

* "%T" and "%D" will display a date or time if you pass a
  [C:/Kernel/Adam1a.HPP.Z,202] CDate.

* "%z" will display a subentry of an enumerated list of text entries.  It 
calls [C:/Kernel/Str1a.CPP.Z,385] LstSub().  Pass subentry first, list second.

* "%Z" will display a Define subentry.  Pass subentry first, lst_define 
second.

* "%Q" will convert "\" to "\\" and quote to backslash quote. (For use in 
creating strs in strs.)

* "%q" will reverse a "%Q".

You highest priority is ... Make playing of ONE fullscreen video game at a 
time as easy to program for as possible with full multicore support.

All applications run on Core 0.  If they want help, they do this:

for (i=0;i<mp_cnt;i++)
  Spawn(&MPDraw,,"Name",i,Fs);

That will place a slave task on each of the other cores.

If you have a flight simulator, you wish to tell each of the other five cores 
to do 1/6th of the rendering in strips.  (I have 8 cores, but I use only six 
in VMware, because Windows need a core otherwise VMware thinks giving me just 
seven is just the same!  LOL)

Nobody else can do this.  I don't think they tell you how many cores.  How
are 
you supposed to know what fraction you are in charge of?  I certainly don't 
want the scheduler to decide to run my task, two on one core!  I have 60Hz 
deadline, I don't want the scheduler fucking around even slightly with what 
core the task is running on.  It is totally unacceptable to run five tasks 
simultaneously, then a 6th after that!

I have master/slave multicore and it is superior and simpler.  SMP is for 
mainframe servers.  

GPU makes it less important.

That's hilarious, huh!  Geniuses really fucked-it-up.  It's the NAZI pride.  
SMP really appeals to the sensibilities of being organized.

Here's something.  I obnoxiously scorned laptops, at first.  I wanted highest 
performance for multicore, so I did not put cores into a HALT state.  (They 
spinned at a flag, buring power.)   If you signal with a memory flag, it is 
faster than doing an interrupt to get it out of HALT.  The overhead for doing 
a multicore job determines how small the jobs can be and still be worthwhile.

I had a BIOS which set-it-up so that the keyboard interrupt worked, but not 
the mouse.  Well, shit!  So, about 60 times a second, I check if a byte is 
waiting from the mouse.

When I did HD Audio, I did not use interrupts.  I checked a thousand times a 
second to see if the DMA buffer needed more speaker output data.

With huge DMA buffers, you could get by without interrupts.  You need a timer 
interrupt.  I thought about DMA done by other cores.

If, for some reason, you wanted clean, minimal silicon.  My operating system 
doesn't require paging.  You could use multicore in place of DMA.  You only 
need a timer interrupt.

You know what?  Only a faggot gets too carried away designing their own CPU.  
You fight the war with the Army you have.

18:6 In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried unto my God: he
heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came before him, even
into his ears.

18:7 Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the
hills moved and were shaken, because he was wroth.

If I draw something, then You might draw something.  It's hard to get up off 
the couch.  Very hard.  I could tell the country, "If you draw art, God will 
talk."  "That's nice."

north, saith the LORD; and they shall come, and they shall set every
one his throne at the entering of the gates of Jerusalem, and against
all the walls thereof round about, and against all the cities of
Judah.

1:16 And I will utter my judgments against them touching all their
wickedness, who have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other
gods, and worshipped the works of their own hands.

1:17 Thou therefore gird up thy loins, and arise, and speak unto them
all that I command thee: be not dismayed at their faces, lest I
confound thee before them.

1:18 For, behold, I have made thee this day a defenced city, and an
iron pillar, and brasen walls against the whole land, against the
kings of Judah, against the princes thereof, against the priests
thereof, and against the people of the land.

1:19 And they shall fight against thee; but they shall not prevail
against thee; for I am with thee, saith the LORD, to deliver thee.

Full of shit, I am.  It's a man with a helmet looking down a gun with sight.  
It's an overhead projector.  It's an angel with wings standing like batman, 
LOL.

That sucked.

I think God likes more psychedelic poetry.  Poetry can be tongues, if you 
learn to say the first thing that pops in your head... that rhymes... and 
reminds you of meanings.  When saying the first thing that pops in your head, 
it backfires most of the time, LOL.  Try it, you'll see.  You'll look stupid, 
lots of times.

There is not disguising that this bears a resemblence to spells.  That makes 
me less enthused.  Use your head Huck Finn, then I'll go to Hell.

118:15 The voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tabernacles of
the righteous: the right hand of the LORD doeth valiantly.

118:16 The right hand of the LORD is exalted: the right hand of the
LORD doeth valiantly.

118:17 I shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the LORD.

118:18 The LORD hath chastened me sore: but he hath not given me over
unto death.

118:19 Open to me the gates of righteousness: I will go into them, and
I will praise the LORD:

118:20 This gate of the LORD, into which the righteous shall enter.

118:21 I will praise thee: for thou hast heard me, and art become my
salvation.

118:22 The stone which the builders refused is become the head stone

It really says "praise", mostly.  I told my sister to praise God and she
said, 
"Thank you for health and..."

If you tell a Catholic to praise God they will thank God.

Praise God for sand castles, bubble translucence, snow men, snow flakes, pop 
corn.


I must be firm.  The Bible says to praise God.  It doesn't say create poems 
that make yourself proud.

"Praise you father because you hid from the wise and revealed to childlike."
"Solomon in all His glory was not dressed like a flower."
"He knows every bird of the heaven.  Not one falls without His notice."

You ever see a farmer feeding animals in the morning.  God has to go around 
the world like Santa Claus feeding all the birds because they starve in one 
day... maybe.

disciples into the boat, but that his disciples were gone away alone;
6:23 (Howbeit there came other boats from Tiberias nigh unto the place
where they did eat bread, after that the Lord had given thanks:) 6:24
When the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there, neither his
disciples, they also took shipping, and came to Capernaum, seeking for
Jesus.

6:25 And when they had found him on the other side of the sea, they
said unto him, Rabbi, when camest thou hither?  6:26 Jesus answered
them and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye seek me, not because
ye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves, and were
filled.

6:27 Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which
endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give unto
you: for him hath God the Father sealed.

6:28 Then said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work the
works of God?  6:29 Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the
work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.

Brendan.  Sigh.  We don't conflict quite as much.

My bootloaders move their own code to a higher, known, location.  One time, I 
learned there is an EBDA, the hard way.  It was very fortunate because there 
was a secret byte in the EBDA that turned-on the mouse.

At this point, you pack your bags and go home.  Fuck them.  PC operating 
systems are a joke clusterfucked by the CIA and shit, probably.

If the BIOS doesn't feel like enabling PS/2 keyboard moused or ATA PIO, fuck 
them.  They might not feel like enabling interrupts.

In the past ten years, I have owned four machines.  Each time I upgraded, my 
operating system was dead until I got it working, except one time out of four.

If statistic sampleing 4 samples and 3 were defective, no reason for hope -- 
I'm in a CIA prison with no feedback, at it would not be pleasant and I could 
do anything.

The only thing that matters is compatibility.  If you are dead in the water
on 
keyboard mouse or screen or hard drive or CDROM, game-over.

Branden wants me to retry if a BIOS disk read routine fails?  ROFLMAO. 
That's 
hilarious.  True for floppies, but silly, now.

little ones, and the cattle, and all that is in the city, even all the
spoil thereof, shalt thou take unto thyself; and thou shalt eat the
spoil of thine enemies, which the LORD thy God hath given thee.

20:15 Thus shalt thou do unto all the cities which are very far off
from thee, which are not of the cities of these nations.

20:16 But of the cities of these people, which the LORD thy God doth
give thee for an inheritance, thou shalt save alive nothing that
breatheth: 20:17 But thou shalt utterly destroy them; namely, the
Hittites, and the Amorites, the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, the
Hivites, and the Jebusites; as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee:
20:18 That they teach you not to do after all their abominations,
which they have done unto their gods; so should ye sin against the
LORD your God.

against it to take it, thou shalt not destroy the trees thereof by
forcing an axe against them: for thou mayest eat of them, and thou
shalt not cut them down (for the tree of the field is man's life) to
