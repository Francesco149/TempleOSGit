[C:/Adam/God/HSNotes.TXT.Z,1] Guidelines for Talking with God

God said it is a covenant to do an offering before consulting Him.  He also 
said "honest measures" applies.  That means you get back love equal to what 
you put into it.

This fucken India-nigger pissed me off.  He insulted God's temple and God's

Russia is against promoting gayness.  God's not hardline, but I think 
promoting gayness goes way too far.  Keep it hidden.  Those fuckers love 
putting penises in everybody's faces.  They are vile hideous creatures.  
Sometimes, a child has the sense to know hideous vile gays from unoffensive 
gays.

Arafat?  When Arafat died, I had one of the only prophecies.  "You will

said, I have gotten a man from the LORD.

4:2 And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of
sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.

4:3 And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the
fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD.

4:4 And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of
the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his
offering: 4:5 But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect.
And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.

4:6 And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy
countenance fallen?  4:7 If thou doest well, shalt thou not be
accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto
thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.

4:8 And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when
they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother,
and slew him.

4:9 And the LORD said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he
said, I know not: Am I my brother's keeper?  4:10 And he said, What
hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from
the ground.

When God is manifest to the World and He claims this operating system, 
publically, here's what I want:

1) VMware to again support PC Speaker and provide emulation if no PC Speaker 
is present.

2) Windows and Linux support RedSea file system in place of FAT32 and
ISO9660. 
 Then, I can remove FAT32 and ISO9660.  (About 2,000 lines of blemished
code.) 
 

3) Windows to burn ISO files to CD/DVD-ROMS.  USB memory sticks are not an 
option, so CD/DVD is what we use.

4) No secure boot.  TempleOS is a additional operating system that must be 
used along-side Windows or Linux.  It must dual boot.

5) Mandate to PC manufacturers that ATA/ATAPI PIO must work.

6) PS2 emulated Keyboard and Mouse must work.  The BIOS must enable these.

7) VMware should allow ATAPI to connect real CD/DVD hardware.

8) Perhaps, VMware can enable faster than standard x86 IN/OUT instruction 
timing for ATA/ATAPI PIO, so the bandwidth isn't as bad.

9) VMware and others should list TempleOS as one of the 64-bit operating 
systems.

10) Windows and Linux should support TempleOS .GRA graphics files.

In other words, all hardware and BIOSes must support TempleOS as a native and 
as a virtual system, dual booted with Windows or Linux.

It would be neat if TempleOS were burned into BIOS ROMs.  My hope is that it 
will be finished and largely unchanging.  I need a good dictionary, first.  
Maybe, we leave the dictionary out.
