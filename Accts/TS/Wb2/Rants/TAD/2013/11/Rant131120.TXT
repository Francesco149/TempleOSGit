all manner of instruments made of fir wood, even on harps, and on

6:6 And when they came to Nachon's threshingfloor, Uzzah put forth his
hand to the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the oxen shook it.

6:7 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzzah; and God smote
him there for his error; and there he died by the ark of God.

6:8 And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach upon
Uzzah: and he called the name of the place Perezuzzah to this day.

6:9 And David was afraid of the LORD that day, and said, How shall the

You know what would be funny?  It would be funny if I had just Chinese 
customers emailing me.  I would squirm a little.  I'm surprised the CIA
hasn't 
tortured me in that way.  I can get big headed and worried.  It's nothing 
difficult, yet it is impressive.

I live in a small number of websites, probably all done by the CIA.  There
are 
no programmers in my league... but I know in the world that there are others.
 
Lots of people would look at the simple stuff I did and think it nothing.

To me... My operating system gives me the same feeling.... It's like when you 
sit down to a Motorola 68020 device with no operating system and start coding 
fresh.  There is nothing you don't need and if you are doing it fresh, it is 
perfect and clean.  There is no ugly code.  At the beginning, it is all 
simple, clean, fresh.  My operating system seems like nothing, to me, as I 
imagine writing for a 68020 -- it is libraries but these aren't ugly, they
are 
just simple libraries.  I imagine PUTCHAR.  I imagine PUTHEX.  When I think
of 
my operating system, it seems like nothing but these perfect little routines
I 
am so familiar with... there is nothing I don't understand.

When I think of my operating system, I kinda have an impression of PUTCHAR
and 
PUTHEX and nothing more.  Am I making sense?

Sad pathetic.

I can imagine an Indian accent, excited and vehement...  "No, thish is not
how 
you do it.  You must do it thish way.  That is absoluetly not correct.  It 
must be like this.  You must have separate address spaces.  It is incorrect.  
This is not acceptable.  It is defective."

It's like an excited Indian is telling me, "You must have ice in your soda.  
It is not acceptible to drink soda without ice.  Absolutely, you must have
ice 
in your soda."  He is very excited about this and sure of himself.

To these Indian guys, Ring-0-only and identity-mapping, is blasphemy to them.
 
To me it's like not having ice in my soda.  (This is not my concern)  The ice 
delutes it.  Privilege level changes slow it down and make it complicated.  
You don't have to have protections and it will be faster and simpler.  It's 
just like not having ice in your soda.  Some people really freak-out.  Look, 
dude, you don't own the store, why do you care?  The store doesn't care, much.

I take ice in my soda, actually, but it's like that.

These people are really freaked-out that I don't have ice in my soda.  I'm 
tired of talking to them.  We argue year after year.  "You must have ice in 
your soda."  I'm not buying it from a store.  Why do you care.  What if some 
poeple enjoy soda with no ice, in private.  I can understand how corrupting 
the young, in public...  LOL

I have way too much ego.  I have to remind myself by watching this video of a 
gulf natural gas processing platform.  There's a square block of pipes and 
complicated stuff that they park above the ocean in the gulf.  They run these 
pipes all over the bottom with ships miles above the floor.

When I think about all that stuff, it seems silly worrying if the Chinese are 
taking a ring-0-only operating system.  Someone tries to raise the specter of 
killer robots.  Come-on!  That oil platform makes my thing look puny.

I'm not sure I made any sense, but it's good for me to remind myself of 
humility.

In 64-bit long mode, to call a nearby routine there is a short, fast 32-bit 
instruction.  It gets slightly uglier when you want to go anywhere in 64-bit 
range.

There are countless inside-the-box assumptions, all the stupid people I deal 
with hold.  "Everything grows.  If you make a limit it will be exceeded. 
Bill 
Gates said 640K would be enough, what an idiot, ba ha."  Bill Gates was 
accepted to Harvard and was pretty damn smart.  All the kids make fun of him.
 
We all know 2 Gig is just like 640K.  We're not stupid, like Bill Gates. 
It's 
obvious, now, that no number will be enough, because of Moores law.  Moores 
law cannot be violated.  That's like the speed of light changing.

I say 2 Gig will be enough for code, for my operating system.

You must have ice in your soda!  This is not acceptible.  It is defective.  
Your operating system is not 64-bit.  It must be PAE mode.  You lie.

them, Whatsoever he be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers in

My operating system will always be changed to fix imperfections.  Most people 
promise backward compatibility?  I promise the opposite, LOL.  I will ALWAYS 
break backward compatibility to keep it perfect.  That's a promise.  I won't 
think twice.  Who knows -- maybe it's perfect, now, though.

I really want to remove support for FAT32 and ISO9660.  I have a simple 
filesystem called "RedSea" that I want Windows and Linux to support.  Not
only 
can RedSea work on hard disk, it can work as CD/DVD by just putting the image 
there.  

The RedSea file system is just like FAT32 but it has an allocation bitmap 
instead of FAT.  It can only have contiguous files and files cannot change 
size to get bigger.  This is not suitable, normally, but for us it's okay. 
An 
additional difference is that the directory entries are fixed-size and
limited 
filename length.  They are 64-byte entries with 38 length including a zero.

Our goal is to be obnoxiously simple.  That's what we live for.  I wake-up 
every day trying to find more ways to be obnoxiously simple.

A CDROM need not have an allocation bitmap.  Oops, I forgot -- I was not even 
thinking about multi-session CDDVD burning.

There are probably times I am not obnoxiously simple.  I don't care.

I am certainly not low resource usage.  Quite the contrary.  I like to use 
resources to make it obnoxiously simple.  When hardware gets more powerful, 
some new possibilities open-up.  Almost all the time, I load and save whole 
files at once.  Traditional file-to-disk virtual memory is obsolete.  Have
you 
ever actually triggered it and seen how unacceptibly slow it is!  If the
guide 
is SWAP equal to RAM size, heck for a factor of two more memory, just buy
more 
memory.  I can understand virtual memory for a factor of ten more memory but
a 
factor of two more memory, just makes no sense because it's so terrible.

Once we calm down, you might soon decide my operating system is no news at 
all.  I'm not keen on the thought of helping drones, so I'm relieved if
mine's 
not hard-real-time.  If you think about it, ring-0-only is not the issue,
it's 
simplicity.  People can do hardware in Linux, but mine is simpler.

I remember the nice, clean, architecture of a Motorola 68020 and starting a 
fresh assembly project with no other code.  That is not sinister.

God said we are being moved-off our ancestrial lands.

So, the horsepower is higher, good for cameras, I guess.

In the past, I would have sought to do robots, and would have tried to make 
them good, as in scary.  I played with a dremel tool on a stepper motor 
platform.  I scratched that itch.  I have no plans and shit is too hard.

Shit is much harder to hook-up.  It used to be simple to do an RS232 serial 
port driver.  Now, sheesh!  <shakes his head>  USB is insanely
overengineered. 
 Ethernet?  Camera?  I don't have any plans for hardware.

Young men should have the feeling of starting fresh on a Motorola 68020 in 
assembly language.  Not literally, but approximately.
