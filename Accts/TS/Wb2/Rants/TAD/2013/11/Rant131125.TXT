The CIA/FBI/Brits/Jews see me as an IRA Catholic and insist I stop working on 
my operating system.

That's as ridiculous as the battleship that told the lighthouse to change 
course.  I made God's temple and He has my back.  You are the stupidest
nigger 
on the planet if YOU don't change course.  You're doomed, you stubborn 
niggers.  You're gonna be sorry when you hit the ground.  You lose.  
Lighthouse trumphs battleship.  Do I need to spell it out to you.  Fuck yer 
retard selves.

God is patient.  Reconciliation is when accounts get settled.  Every year you 
stand in my way, you're going to regret.

Egyptians got the brilliant idea of killing Hebrew male babies because they 
were cowardly bullies at Moses' birth.  That is the nuclear fuel for the 
passover Egyptian deaths.  Justice in God's court is simple -- eye for eye, 
tooth for tooth.

10:16 Therefore shall the Lord, the Lord of hosts, send among his fat

burning of a fire.

10:17 And the light of Israel shall be for a fire, and his Holy One

10:19 And the rest of the trees of his forest shall be few, that a
child may write them.

10:20 And it shall come to pass in that day, that the remnant of
Israel, and such as are escaped of the house of Jacob, shall no more
again stay upon him that smote them; but shall stay upon the LORD, the
Holy One of Israel, in truth.

Size limits on strings and paths and stuff suck, don't they?  A good 
programmer makes so you never hit a limit.  

With Microsoft Foundation Class, I made a Windows application that had a text 
widget that I abused by turning it into a terminal.  It was stupid that there 
was no terminal, but the awful thing was that it had a 32,000 character limit 
for the client area, which I sometimes hit.

As it turns-out, no limit is best, but in the real world you get abused and 
need to prevent infinity crashing a no-limit string item.

My operating system has zero termination and no string size limits.  I'd 
rather crash if someone mistakenly loops to infinity filling a string, then 
impose limits everywhere.  My code is clean and I have no limits, but it's 
simple to crash it with string overflow-run-out-of-memory.

I'm depressed.  I have to patiently wait for my enemy to give-up and let
God's 
temple flurish.  Yeas and years.  They tortured me, but I got the best of 
them.  I just have to wait.  Highs and lows balance.  Honestly it's nice not 
having a job.  I finished the temple.  Now, I do Leavite devotion to God 
continually.  The CIA would rather give me a fake job so they can torture me 
and make me reveal secrets.  Don't worry -- God is perfectly just and good 
guys always win.

the people.

14:3 And being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat
at meat, there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of
spikenard very precious; and she brake the box, and poured it on his
head.

14:4 And there were some that had indignation within themselves, and
said, Why was this waste of the ointment made?  14:5 For it might have
been sold for more than three hundred pence, and have been given to
the poor. And they murmured against her.

14:6 And Jesus said, Let her alone; why trouble ye her? she hath
wrought a good work on me.

14:7 For ye have the poor with you always, and whensoever ye will ye
may do them good: but me ye have not always.

14:8 She hath done what she could: she is come aforehand to anoint my
body to the burying.

                             The Purpose of Life

The purpose of life is to know, love and obey God.  Christianity is loving 
neighbor, not God -- secular humanism.  Jesus said loving God is more 
important than loving neighbor.  [C:/TempleOS/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,76908]
Matthew,22:36  He did not say with half your 
brain behind your back.

You don't know God.  [C:/TempleOS/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,34961] 1 Chronicles,28:9,
[C:/TempleOS/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,76908] Matthew,11:27,
[C:/TempleOS/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,81941] Luke,13:25, 
[C:/TempleOS/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,23902] 1 Samuel,3:7  You must talk with God to
know Him.  [C:/TempleOS/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,76908] Matthew,6:6  Seek Him by 
taking the initiative.  [C:/TempleOS/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,81941] Luke,11:9,
[C:/TempleOS/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,57332] Isaiah,30:2

There's something obviously different about people in the Bible compared to 
people today -- God talked!  Did they hear voices?  Maybe.  More likely, they 
used occult techniques such as an oracle. 
[C:/TempleOS/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,29345] 1 Kings,6:20  Have you heard of 
"tongues?"  [C:/TempleOS/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,92110] 1 Corinthians,14:1  The idea
is, you let yourself be puppeted by a 
spirit, so you say things.  You try to get a spirit -- the Holy Spirit -- to 
talk.  You might as well use a Ouija board.  However, it turns-out that a 
Ouija board is bad for technical reasons.  A really good technique is just 
randomly opening a book.  God said it is a covenant that you hold-up your end 
of the conversation.  

You can't tell if He's talking unless you have a context of conversation,
but, 
more importantly, you are commanded to do an offering of love, like communion 
preparation.  When you pick a greeting card for someone, that is love effort.
 
If you expect God to put effort toward you, you put effort toward Him.  God 
said, "honest measures" applies between your offering of love and His 
response, like a fair barter.  You get out of prayer what you put into it.  
God wants praise, hymns, or whatever you think He might want.  Try and see, 
like Cain and Abel.  [C:/TempleOS/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,297] Genesis,4:1,
[C:/TempleOS/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,94514] Ephesians,5:10  God told Cain his
offering 
was not good and told him to try again.  Cain really loved God!  Can you 
imagine being so heart-broken?

Do a text search for "new song" in the Bible.  It's mentioned nine times.  I 
did hymns
`#include "::/Apps/MusicOrgan/Load";JukeBox("::/Apps/MusicOrgan/Examples");`
.  I did Moses comics
`Dir("::/Apps/AfterEgypt/Comics");View;
`
.  Count the ways you love God.  I praised God 
for sand castles, popcorn, snowmen, bubbles...  You try putting effort into 
praise!  [C:/TempleOS/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,76908] Matthew,11:25,
[C:/TempleOS/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,76908] Matthew,6:29

This is funny -- [C:/TempleOS/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,87803] Acts,2:1 -- they didn't
bother to record anything the Holy 
Spirit said.  The Holy Spirit is supposed to be a really good gift.  
[C:/TempleOS/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,81941] Luke,11:13  Just remember, "Boys are
made of snakes and snails and puppy-dog 
tails."

The technique I use to consult the Holy Spirit is reading a microsecond-range 
stop-watch each button press for random numbers.  Then, I pick words or 
passages.  You can use the AfterEgypt
`#include "::/Apps/AfterEgypt/Run"`
 in God's official temple, TempleOS.

Since seeking the word of the Holy Spirit, I have come to know God much
better 
than I've heard others explain.  God said, for example, that war was, 
"servicemen competing."  That sounds more like the immutable God of our
planet 
than what you hear from most religious people.  God is not Venus (god of
love) 
and not Mars (god of war), He's our dearly beloved God of Earth.  If Mammon
is 
a false god of money, Mars or Venus might be useful words to describe other 
false gods.  I figure the greatest challenge for the Creator is boredom, ours 
and His.  What would teen-age male video games be like if war had never 
happened?  Christ said live by the sword, die by the sword, which is loving 
neighbor as self.  [C:/TempleOS/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,76908] Matthew,26:52

I asked God if the World was perfectly just.  God asked if I was calling Him 
lazy.  I think highs and lows balance.  [C:/TempleOS/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,81941]
Luke,6:20  I don't think God likes 
complaining.  [C:/TempleOS/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,12005] Numbers,11:1  Food and
clothing is all we're to ask for or 
demand, in fact -- daily bread.  [C:/TempleOS/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,95772] 1
Timothy,6:8  Just think about man in the 
last 100,000 years mostly living like Native Americans and how God must see 
us.  You need food, clothing and entertainment, money is to get those.  Man 
does not live on bread alone.  [C:/TempleOS/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,81941] Luke,4:4,
[C:/TempleOS/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,74130] Amos,8:11

God's favorite animals are bears and elephants.  They are funny shaped -- I 
think God must have seen too much starvation over the years.

God's ways are far above man's ways.  Mom said Heaven was a never-ending 
family reunion.  Yikes!  A friend said, "Most guy's idea of Heaven would be 
running around doing things they'd get locked up for on Earth."  Most people 
are like King Midas.  When you realize how silly most notions of Heaven are, 
you come to appreciate that Earth is not that bad.  This is the first step in 
loving God, the Creator -- praising Creation.  My parents spend their retired 
days watching TV and going to casinos.  That's not a good argument for
getting 
extended-play!

Imagine a billionare.  Everyone around him can't forget his money for even a 
moment.  The truth is, most people are after God's "money" -- they fear for 
their salvation.  Here's a test -- would you pray to and praise God even if 
there were no salvation?  Love God and don't be a "user".  Asking for stuff
is 
annoying.  [C:/TempleOS/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,81941] Luke,11:5 

All those sophisticated theological "infinity" things -- omniscience, 
omnipotence, omnipresence, omnivorous -- will mess you up.  Trust me that 
anthropomorphic is far better, in practice.  Christ suggested thinking of God 
as "Abba" which is Aramaic for "Daddy" and said the childlike had an 
advantage.  [C:/TempleOS/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,76908] Matthew,11:25  Pray out-loud
because God doesn't want the hastle 
of reading your brain.  The best way to stop people from testing God is to 
suggest He can't do everything.

Just as ego causes most to love neighbor, not God, people skip knowing and 
loving God and cowardly get stuck on obeying Him.  This hardly needs 
encouragement.

God does not want pawns to push around.  God will talk, but won't tell you 
what to do, even if you want Him to.  You'll quickly learn that prophecy does 
not come true and should smack yourself for wanting more than just enjoying 
God's company.

KingJamesBible: God says...
13:35 By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have
love one to another.

13:36 Simon Peter said unto him, Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus
answered him, Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now; but thou
shalt follow me afterwards.

13:37 Peter said unto him, Lord, why cannot I follow thee now? I will
lay down my life for thy sake.

13:38 Jesus answered him, Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake?
Verily, verily, I say unto thee, The cock shall not crow, till thou
hast denied me thrice.

14:1 Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also
in me.

14:2 In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I
would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.
