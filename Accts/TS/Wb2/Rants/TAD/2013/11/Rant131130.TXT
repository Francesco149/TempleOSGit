 Don't remind Him of sin.

ask God to not do justice.  Forget about sin.  Leave justice and sins out of 
your relationship with God.  God is a relationship -- with the Creator.

5:7 And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD
unto his place, to the oracle of the house, into the most holy place,
even under the wings of the cherubims: 5:8 For the cherubims spread
forth their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubims covered
the ark and the staves thereof above.

5:9 And they drew out the staves of the ark, that the ends of the
staves were seen from the ark before the oracle; but they were not

Obey my voice, and I will be your God, and ye shall be my people: and

13:1 And, behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by the word of
the LORD unto Bethel: and Jeroboam stood by the altar to burn incense.

13:2 And he cried against the altar in the word of the LORD, and said,
O altar, altar, thus saith the LORD; Behold, a child shall be born
unto the house of David, Josiah by name; and upon thee shall he offer
the priests of the high places that burn incense upon thee, and men's
bones shall be burnt upon thee.

13:3 And he gave a sign the same day, saying, This is the sign which
the LORD hath spoken; Behold, the altar shall be rent, and the ashes
that are upon it shall be poured out.

13:4 And it came to pass, when king Jeroboam heard the saying of the
man of God, which had cried against the altar in Bethel, that he put
forth his hand from the altar, saying, Lay hold on him. And his hand,
which he put forth against him, dried up, so that he could not pull it
in again to him.

13:8 And David and all Israel played before God with all their might,
and with singing, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with
timbrels, and with cymbals, and with trumpets.

13:9 And when they came unto the threshingfloor of Chidon, Uzza put
forth his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen stumbled.

13:10 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzza, and he smote
him, because he put his hand to the ark: and there he died before God.

possessions of great and small cattle above all that were in Jerusalem

Software interrupts are neat, but too slow.  Also, the stack can't be used
for 
passing args very easily.  If you pass args in REGS, then software interrupts

4:15 They cried unto them, Depart ye; it is unclean; depart, depart,
touch not: when they fled away and wandered, they said among the
heathen, They shall no more sojourn there.

4:16 The anger of the LORD hath divided them; he will no more regard
them: they respected not the persons of the priests, they favoured not
the elders.

4:17 As for us, our eyes as yet failed for our vain help: in our
watching we have watched for a nation that could not save us.

4:18 They hunt our steps, that we cannot go in our streets: our end is
near, our days are fulfilled; for our end is come.

4:19 Our persecutors are swifter than the eagles of the heaven: they
pursued us upon the mountains, they laid wait for us in the
wilderness.

In 1990 at age 20, I was hired to work on Ticketmaster's VAX operating system 
in assembly language.  In 1983 at age 13, I wrote a 6502 asm routine to plot
a 
line.

ASU Transcripts

I took 5 assembly-language-based courses in school.  
CSC226,CSC326,CSE421,CSE422,CSE523.

I took operating systems, compilers, numeric methods, graphics.

I have specialized for 23 years as a system's programmer with paid work 
experience programming in the following architectures.

VAX asm
8086 asm
8051 asm
68000 asm
PIC asm
AVR asm

I am a black belt asm programmer.  I wrote a 64-bit compiler and a assembler 
for this operating system.

Take my 64-bit assembly test, you fucken India-nigger.

I am the chosen programmer of the whole world to make God's temple.

I have used divine intellect.  It must be perfect.
