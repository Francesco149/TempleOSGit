give it thee; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee:

land, saying, But if thou wilt give it, I pray thee, hear me: I will
give thee money for the field; take it of me, and I will bury my dead
there.

hearken unto me: the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver;
what is that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead.

21:3 If he came in by himself, he shall go out by himself: if he were
married, then his wife shall go out with him.

21:4 If his master have given him a wife, and she have born him sons
or daughters; the wife and her children shall be her master's, and he
shall go out by himself.

21:5 And if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife,
and my children; I will not go out free: 21:6 Then his master shall
bring him unto the judges; he shall also bring him to the door, or
unto the door post; and his master shall bore his ear through with an
aul; and he shall serve him for ever.

21:7 And if a man sell his daughter to be a maidservant, she shall not
go out as the menservants do.

21:8 If she please not her master, who hath betrothed her to himself,
then shall he let her be redeemed: to sell her unto a strange nation
he shall have no power, seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her.

Bears Fishing

God's favorite animal is bears (then, elephants).

Say something about bears, God!

You have to feed them all.  Lotta work and stress.  Poor bears starve.

For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in

father.

said, Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will certainly requite us
all the evil which we did unto him.

What do You remember about the 70's and 80's, God?  I forget that I was a kid

Do You remember close encounters?
Dungeons and Dragons?

34:30 And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold,
the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to come nigh him.

34:31 And Moses called unto them; and Aaron and all the rulers of the
congregation returned unto him: and Moses talked with them.

34:32 And afterward all the children of Israel came nigh: and he gave
them in commandment all that the LORD had spoken with him in mount
Sinai.

34:33 And till Moses had done speaking with them, he put a vail on his

34:34 But when Moses went in before the LORD to speak with him, he
took the vail off, until he came out. And he came out, and spake unto
the children of Israel that which he was commanded.

his father, to Goshen, and presented himself unto him; and he fell on
his neck, and wept on his neck a good while.

Lets talk about cathederals.  You like bells?  Plowshares and prooninghooks.  
Bells.  Some bell ringers fly.  You think they go deaf?  Huge cathederals.  
I'm amazed people got around before cars.  I wonder how so many people were
