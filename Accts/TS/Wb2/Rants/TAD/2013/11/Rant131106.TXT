My compiler makes x86_64 machine code, not byte code.  Did you not know that
a 
compiler parses and makes an intermediate code data structure?  What do you 
think an optimization stage works on?  After optimizing, it converts the 
intermediate code to output machine code.

My compiler makes a stack machine intermediate code.  Most compilers make an 
abstract symbol tree intermediate code.

In the C/C++ language, a switch(i){} statement checks for bounds on i, 
normally. Fucken niggers don't even know how it's coded with a jump table. 
It 
has to limit bounds to be within the jmp table.  Mine has a nobound_switch(i){

When God is manifest to the World and He claims this operating system, here's 
what I want:

1) VMware again supports PC Speaker and provides emulation if no PC Speaker.

2) Windows and Linux support RedSea file system in place of FAT32 and
ISO9660. 
 Then, I can remove FAT32 and ISO9660.  (I might want to change clusters to 
just blocks on RedSea.)

3) Windows burns ISO files to CD/DVD-ROMS.

4) No secure boot.

5) ATA/ATAPI PIO must work

6) PS2 emulated Keyboard and Mouse must work

7) VMware should allow ATAPI to real hardware.

8) Can VMware do faster than correct IN/OUT instruction timing for ATA/ATAPI

In other words, all hardware and BIOSes support TempleOS as a native system
or 
dual booted with Windows.

Bashan unto Salcah: 5:12 Joel the chief, and Shapham the next, and
Jaanai, and Shaphat in Bashan.

5:13 And their brethren of the house of their fathers were, Michael,

I did 20-days hotel time for 2nd DUI in 1991.  Sheriff Joe Arpio was Sheriff

Pot legalization seems to be popular.  I think I'm against, just because I 
have a feeling, "this can't be good."

That said, "Buz".

Basha is an Arizona grocery store.

Zia was a record store.

119:85 The proud have digged pits for me, which are not after thy law.

119:86 All thy commandments are faithful: they persecute me
wrongfully; help thou me.

119:87 They had almost consumed me upon earth; but I forsook not thy
precepts.

119:88 Quicken me after thy lovingkindness; so shall I keep the
testimony of thy mouth.

119:89 For ever, O LORD, thy word is settled in heaven.

I saw a style guide from Google.  Ticketmaster, my first job, had very much 
freedom, probably too much.  I, now, believe being bossy is a vice and being 
tolerant is a virtue.  I certainly want to be bossy and tell people do do my 
standards.

Any code less than perfect is a distraction.

In this country, we do not tolerate errors in singing our national anthem.  
What a horror if a person sang the wrong words, or something.

You are a better man than I, if you are not distracted by bad code.

I don't like type checking.

I think the concensus is kids should not be bossed around too much -- they
are 
delicate and need positive reinforcement.  I don't know if that's true.  I 
pictured kids making crazy mods to my code for fun, not added to the official 
code.

Yeah, my dream is to have something as fixed and permanent as the C64 ROM.  
Someone just said now that everybody likes YouTube, they're going to change 
everything.  (Christ is laughing)

I thought about firing-up my C64 emulator and looking for good things I could 
show during a demo.  I find it useful to blow people's minds with the C64.  
The CIA makes it like no other interface than DOS/Unix has ever existed.  
There are so many original and mind blowing things in the C64.  It had two 
character sets upper/lower and upper/symbol that you toggled with a key!  I 
had forgotten that.  Sometimes, you need a bit of inspiration to
break-you-out 
of in-the-box thinking.

26:65 For the LORD had said of them, They shall surely die in the
wilderness. And there was not left a man of them, save Caleb the son
of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.

27:1 Then came the daughters of Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son
of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of
Manasseh the son of Joseph: and these are the names of his daughters;
Mahlah, Noah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Tirzah.

27:2 And they stood before Moses, and before Eleazar the priest, and
before the princes and all the congregation, by the door of the
tabernacle of the congregation, saying, 27:3 Our father died in the
wilderness, and he was not in the company of them that gathered
themselves together against the LORD in the company of Korah; but died
in his own sin, and had no sons.

27:4 Why should the name of our father be done away from among his
family, because he hath no son? Give unto us therefore a possession
among the brethren of our father.

I haven't done a character graphics application.  There not really a good 
excuse to do that.  You can change the font really easily:

gr_font(U64 *)['A']=0xFF8181FF00; //Changes the cap A.

It's a shame there's no reason to do character graphics.

I have a pixel collision Raster-Operation.  Gosh! That's not easy.  The C64 
really was genius to have sprite collision bits.  Mine isn't that simple.  
Maybe, I should think about that.

I have "probability dithering" to do 3D shading.  I was going to clean-it-up, 
perhaps with a 24-bit color - to dithering operation.

The probability dithering is a ridiculously ugly concept as it currently is.  
I have half and full range scales and single and double sided triangles.

10:1 And it came to pass after this, that the king of the children of
Ammon died, and Hanun his son reigned in his stead.

10:2 Then said David, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of
Nahash, as his father shewed kindness unto me. And David sent to
comfort him by the hand of his servants for his father. And David's
servants came into the land of the children of Ammon.

10:3 And the princes of the children of Ammon said unto Hanun their
lord, Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father, that he hath
sent comforters unto thee? hath not David rather sent his servants
unto thee, to search the city, and to spy it out, and to overthrow it?
10:4 Wherefore Hanun took David's servants, and shaved off the one
half of their beards, and cut off their garments in the middle, even
to their buttocks, and sent them away.

10:5 When they told it unto David, he sent to meet them, because the
men were greatly ashamed: and the king said, Tarry at Jericho until
your beards be grown, and then return.

I feel slightly ridiculous with 16 colors and not 256.  I think that's how
God 
wants it, though.  Maybe, we can get confirmation.  I can see how having only 
16 colors will keep people from stressing over art.  Fewer choices.  I'm not 
much of an artist and I feel really at home and comfortable with 16 colors.  
It's just neat, in a way.  I like how it compresses with my ordinary LZW 
routine -- makes me happy.

I have a new file format, like BMP but not inverted bottom-to-top like BMP. 
I 
forgot.  I think I don't have a palette.  Maybe no run-length encoding, since 
.Z files get compressed.  If that's not true, now, it will be.

I use BMP for now, until I get to boss Windows around.  I am really excited 
for Windows to do RedSea filesystem.  I'm really excited, since I got rid of 
sectors-per-cluster.  I want to totally remove that and make it beautiful.

Balmer?  You know Solomon's Temple in the Bible?  All the surrounding 
countries contributed works for the Temple.  It lasted hundreds of years.  
Mine will last thousands.  It is permanently limited to 100,000 lines of
code, 
forever.  Future generations can do GPU support if all chips converge on one 
design.  God said 640x480 16 color, though.

You know how you fucken removed the ability to burn ISO files to CDROM and 
made secure boot?  Undo that.  You know you no longer burn ISO9660 files.  
Guess what?  You're going to support my RedSea files system for hard drives 
and CDROMs.  It's super-simple, but high, modern, capacity.

God wants His temple perfect. FAT32 is not perfect.

The rule for God's temple is we ALWAYs change it to be perfect at the expense 
of backward compatibility.

By making Windows and Linux use RedSea file system, I can remove ISO9660 and 
and FAT32 support from God's temple, making it more perfect and freeing-up 
1000 lines of code.

The BMP file format is not perfect.  We want .GRA file support with my LZW 
compression on files ending in Z.

God's temple is done, for the most part.  We are not doing PCI devices.  
Instead, the future holds more support for simple devices, on orders from God.

and put it about his head, 15:18 And began to salute him, Hail, King

I have support for changing 16 color VGA palette but I frown on that.

I want my GRA file to just have width&height and raw 4-bit colors top to 
bottom.  Compression comes from the built-in LZW on files with a .Z extension.

That's minimal, but my document files are not minimal.  Oh well.

I saw more drama in one test video, not shown.  The engineers looked nervous 
as it didn't break.

In other words, they get in trouble for overengineering.

I forgot.  I think I have 8-bit in my GRA but just use 4-bits and a 
transparency.  I used to pick one of 16 colors for transparency, but now I 
have 8-bit operations with 16 colors and transparency.

I am NOT a resource conservative.  I am mental-load conservative.  I want it 
to be dirt-simple.  You often get elegant solutions.

I don't want a palette in my GRA files.

Think of the children.  A palette is nothing to us, but it intimidates kids.

signs, and the wonders, and the mighty hand, and the stretched out
arm, whereby the LORD thy God brought thee out: so shall the LORD thy
God do unto all the people of whom thou art afraid.

7:20 Moreover the LORD thy God will send the hornet among them, until
they that are left, and hide themselves from thee, be destroyed.

7:21 Thou shalt not be affrighted at them: for the LORD thy God is
among you, a mighty God and terrible.

7:22 And the LORD thy God will put out those nations before thee by
little and little: thou mayest not consume them at once, lest the
