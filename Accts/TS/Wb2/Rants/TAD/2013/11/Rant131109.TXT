shall it be in the end of this world.

13:41 The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall
gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do
iniquity; 13:42 And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there
shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.

13:43 Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom
of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.

field; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof
goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.

Once you know the world is perfectly just, you can "hack" it.  If you give-up 
some reward you are due, you get compensated with something else.

"A pearl that you sell all for."  "A treasure in a field."  God's wit can be 
reward.  Perhaps, being inspired as a Muse when late in life, beyond the 
age...

Don't worry -- God can vouch that I made everything in the operating system
