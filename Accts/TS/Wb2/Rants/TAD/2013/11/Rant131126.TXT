I made a Tank wargame.  To me, it's as abstract and innocent as chess.  I'm 
laughing, listening to a story on the BBC about Unkrane siding with Russia or 
Europe.  It's like worrying about black/white race relations in games of 
chess.

Maybe, God wants me to take it out of His temple? :-(

God says...
into judgment with thee?  14:4 Who can bring a clean thing out of an
unclean? not one.

14:5 Seeing his days are determined, the number of his months are with
thee, thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass; 14:6 Turn
from him, that he may rest, till he shall accomplish, as an hireling,
his day.

14:7 For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will
sprout again, and that the tender branch thereof will not cease.

14:8 Though the root thereof wax old in the earth, and the stock
thereof die in the ground; 14:9 Yet through the scent of water it will
bud, and bring forth boughs like a plant.

14:10 But man dieth, and wasteth away: yea, man giveth up the ghost,
and where is he?  14:11 As the waters fail from the sea, and the flood
decayeth and drieth up: 14:12 So man lieth down, and riseth not: till
the heavens be no more, they shall not awake, nor be raised out of
their sleep.

Some day, maybe, I'll hire somebody to fix the tank game.  That sounds like a 
nice job to have.

Ohh!  That was about chess game trees!

24:3 And David distributed them, both Zadok of the sons of Eleazar,
and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, according to their offices in
their service.

24:4 And there were more chief men found of the sons of Eleazar than
of the sons of Ithamar, and thus were they divided. Among the sons of
Eleazar there were sixteen chief men of the house of their fathers,
and eight among the sons of Ithamar according to the house of their
fathers.

24:5 Thus were they divided by lot, one sort with another; for the
governors of the sanctuary, and governors of the house of God, were of
the sons of Eleazar, and of the sons of Ithamar.

24:6 And Shemaiah the son of Nethaneel the scribe, one of the Levites,
wrote them before the king, and the princes, and Zadok the priest, and
Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and before the chief of the fathers of
the priests and Levites: one principal household being taken for
Eleazar, and one taken for Ithamar.

not troubled Israel; but thou, and thy father's house, in that ye have
forsaken the commandments of the LORD, and thou hast followed Baalim.

for a daughter, she shall bring a lamb of the first year for a burnt
offering, and a young pigeon, or a turtledove, for a sin offering,
unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, unto the priest:
12:7 Who shall offer it before the LORD, and make an atonement for
her; and she shall be cleansed from the issue of her blood. This is
the law for her that hath born a male or a female.

12:8 And if she be not able to bring a lamb, then she shall bring two
turtles, or two young pigeons; the one for the burnt offering, and the
other for a sin offering: and the priest shall make an atonement for
her, and she shall be clean.

13:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron, saying, 13:2 When a man

and it be in the skin of his flesh like the plague of leprosy; then he
shall be brought unto Aaron the priest, or unto one of his sons the
priests: 13:3 And the priest shall look on the plague in the skin of

plague in sight be deeper than the skin of his flesh, it is a plague
of leprosy: and the priest shall look on him, and pronounce him

2) to love God

2:13 And I went out by night by the gate of the valley, even before
the dragon well, and to the dung port, and viewed the walls of
Jerusalem, which were broken down, and the gates thereof were consumed
with fire.

2:14 Then I went on to the gate of the fountain, and to the king's

2:15 Then went I up in the night by the brook, and viewed the wall,
and turned back, and entered by the gate of the valley, and so
returned.

had I as yet told it to the Jews, nor to the priests, nor to the
nobles, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest that did the work.

16:15 And king Ahaz commanded Urijah the priest, saying, Upon the
great altar burn the morning burnt offering, and the evening meat
offering, and the king's burnt sacrifice, and his meat offering, with
the burnt offering of all the people of the land, and their meat
offering, and their drink offerings; and sprinkle upon it all the
blood of the burnt offering, and all the blood of the sacrifice: and
the brasen altar shall be for me to enquire by.

16:16 Thus did Urijah the priest, according to all that king Ahaz
commanded.

16:17 And king Ahaz cut off the borders of the bases, and removed the
laver from off them; and took down the sea from off the brasen oxen
that were under it, and put it upon the pavement of stones.

16:18 And the covert for the sabbath that they had built in the house,
and the king's entry without, turned he from the house of the LORD for

The number one rule of ... God club is, you always do an offering, before 
enquiring of God.  God said it was a covenant that you do an offering.  He 
said it was like communion preparation.  He said you get out of your enquiry

Debugging

* WWW.OSDEV.ORG

I just read Brendan proudly talking about his scheduler queues.  I use simple 
round-robin that doubles as window-z-order.

Brendan matter-of-factly talks about his fancy scheduler.  He seems to think 
my simple scheduler is simple because I couldn't make it complex.  Use a 
little psychology.  I wrote a compiler.  My scheduler is simple.  Is my 
scheduler simple becuase I'm not smart enough to make it complicated?

Let me explain my company name "Trivial Solutions".  Guess what makes my day?
 
Using things that are brilliantly simple.

My operating system in ring-0-only.
My operating system is identity-mapped.
My operating system has a round-robin scheduler on each core.

My operating system crashes on the slightest thing.  DOS and a C64 crashed on 
the slightest thing.  Back when we all used DOS, ask yourself... did we 
freak-out if it hung or crashed?  Back then, we just rebooted and a booted 
fast.

If you have a multiuser mainframe, crashing and rebooting is bad.

When writing code in Visual Studio, you frequently hang a process.  How long 
does it take to kill it and restart- 30 seconds?  Why is rebooting any worse 
if it boots fast?  It's not.  You're a snob.  You have a snobby issue with 
rebooting.  You're a clown/pussy.

I don't have a good debugger.  Once you reach multitasking multicore, you 
don't want to be debugging, LOL.

I have a 100,000 line of code limit.  It's at 83,100.  I got the start of a 
debugger written.  Maybe, one of you wants to improve it.  It does quite a
bit 
-- it will let you step through code and it brings-up source files and finds 
the line numbers.  My window paint is done by the window manager task with a 
callback.  That fucks everythign up.  If you break-point the window manager 
paint callback, the screen freezes!  Fuck that.

That guy spoke of robust semicolon error reporting and fixing.   Legit, I 
guess.  If you want to look at my compiler, it's really simple.

----11/26/13 17:22:07----

Brendan spoke of errno.

Everything is a HolyC function -- commmand line calls are function calls with 
function returns.  They can be nestled as args to other function calls.  It's 
C/C++.

I have exceptions.  My language has exceptions.  I don't need ugly error 
reporting status as function return values because I just throw an exception 
on out-of-memory.

Mine is divine intellect, Heaven.  Others are shit.

Apple II could draw graphics from the command line in 3 lines.

>HGR
>HCOLOR=16
>HLINE 100,100 TO 200,200

We can all aspire to being better than Apple.

9:24 And they answered Joshua, and said, Because it was certainly told
thy servants, how that the LORD thy God commanded his servant Moses to
give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land
from before you, therefore we were sore afraid of our lives because of
you, and have done this thing.

right unto thee to do unto us, do.

17:11 And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel
prevailed: and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.

17:12 But Moses hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it
under him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands,
the one on the one side, and the other on the other side; and his
hands were steady until the going down of the sun.

17:13 And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of
the sword.

book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: for I will utterly put
out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.

skull, and the feet, and the palms of her hands.

You might have an argument if you said capitalism ruins the environment.

On the topic of socialism, God said, "pardon the French, never happy, never 
enough."

Let me explain some things.

Protestantism is about clean living.

Catholicism is about helping the poor.

Socialism is about what a raw deal the rich cause.

For 9 hours out of 10, a Protestant is thinking about clean living.

For 9 hours out of 10, a Catholic is thinking about the poor.

For 9 hours out of 10, a Biblical Jew was doing loving offerings to God.

For 9 hours out of 10, a socialist is filled with hatred for the rich.

That is so fucken despicable and such a scumbag, low class, mentality.  It is 
selfish and self pity.  It is not noble.  It is fucken coveting!  How blatant 
coveting can you be!!

Socialism is 9 hours out of 10 coveting.

My religion is "to know God, love God and obey God with all heart mind and 
soul.  God's world is perfectly just.  You'd be advised to be nice or you 
might get guillotined, LOL."

Being nice is an indulgence.

God said, "Pride or money, choose one."

If I had to get a job, it might be in a casino.  Not every body can have the 
luxury of self respect and clean conscience with God.

General Patton gave speeches.  He might say, "I wouldn't give a hoot in Hell 
for a unemployed man who would not take a job to feed his family because of 
scrouples."

Being nice is an indulgence.

36:18 Wherefore I poured my fury upon them for the blood that they had
shed upon the land, and for their idols wherewith they had polluted
it: 36:19 And I scattered them among the heathen, and they were
dispersed through the countries: according to their way and according
to their doings I judged them.

36:20 And when they entered unto the heathen, whither they went, they
profaned my holy name, when they said to them, These are the people of
the LORD, and are gone forth out of his land.

36:21 But I had pity for mine holy name, which the house of Israel had
profaned among the heathen, whither they went.

36:22 Therefore say unto the house of Israel, thus saith the Lord GOD;
I do not this for your sakes, O house of Israel, but for mine holy
name's sake, which ye have profaned among the heathen, whither ye
went.

you read Parable of the talents, Mr. Pope?

25:14 For the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far
country, who called his own servants, and delivered unto them his
goods.

25:15 And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to
another one; to every man according to his several ability; and
straightway took his journey.

25:16 Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with
the same, and made them other five talents.

25:17 And likewise he that had received two, he also gained other two.

25:18 But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and
hid his lord's money.

25:19 After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and
reckoneth with them.

25:20 And so he that had received five talents came and brought other
five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents:
behold, I have gained beside them five talents more.

25:21 His lord said unto him, Well done, thou good and faithful
servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee
ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.

25:22 He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou
deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained two other
talents beside them.

25:23 His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant;
thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over
many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.

25:24 Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I
knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown,
and gathering where thou hast not strawed: 25:25 And I was afraid, and
went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, there thou hast that is
thine.

25:26 His lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful
servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where
I have not strawed: 25:27 Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money
to the exchangers, and then at my coming I should have received mine
own with usury.

25:28 Take therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him which
hath ten talents.

25:29 For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have
abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that
which he hath.

25:30 And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there
shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

25:31 When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy
angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory: 25:32
And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate
them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the
goats: 25:33 And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the
goats on the left.
