14:45 And the people said unto Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who hath
wrought this great salvation in Israel? God forbid: as the LORD

he hath wrought with God this day. So the people rescued Jonathan,

LORD appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David,
fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived
in her is of the Holy Ghost.

1:21 And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name
JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins.

1:22 Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was
spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, 1:23 Behold, a virgin shall
be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his
name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us.

1:24 Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord
had bidden him, and took unto him his wife: 1:25 And knew her not till
she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name JESUS.

2:1 Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of
Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to
Jerusalem, 2:2 Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for
we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him.

I could comment on the act of pulling formulas out of your ass.  Everyone's 
got an ass to do it with -- might want to be humble.  The truth is, Einstein 
did that for relativity.  What do you think he did?  He pulled it out of his 
ass.  Don't be too conceited if you never expand the out-side-the-box box,
you 
will absolutely certainly never be great.

Gadwa might have taken a dim view of games.  I sort-off agree.  Mostly you 
don't want to brag about formulas you pulled out of your ass, but that IS 
where all formulas come from, LOL.

The only point I want to make is... it is not just the elite engineers who
can 
pull a formula out of their ass.  Most engineers can probably do it.  Pulling 
formulas out of your ass is not the most difficult thing you can do, 
generally.

On the other hand, if you've ever tried it, it is very daunting.  I guess
it's 
like the grudging respect and engineer has to pay to an artist who has 
wonderful original ideas.

I sat down to write a Plymoth Rock pilgrim game... formulas for a pilgrim
