32:9 For when they went up unto the valley of Eshcol, and saw the
land, they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel, that they
should not go into the land which the LORD had given them.

32:10 And the LORD's anger was kindled the same time, and he sware,
saying, 32:11 Surely none of the men that came up out of Egypt, from
twenty years old and upward, shall see the land which I sware unto
Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob; because they have not wholly
followed me: 32:12 Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite, and
Joshua the son of Nun: for they have wholly followed the LORD.

32:13 And the LORD's anger was kindled against Israel, and he made
them wander in the wilderness forty years, until all the generation,
that had done evil in the sight of the LORD, was consumed.

32:14 And, behold, ye are risen up in your fathers' stead, an increase
of sinful men, to augment yet the fierce anger of the LORD toward
Israel.

wasn't a lion.

Someone suggested I program more and blog less.  It's finished.  A manager is 
paid more because it's harder to know what to do that doing it.  My vision is 
complete.  I crossed-over from 1st generation to PCI generation hardware with 
an HD Audio driver.  After a year or two, I came to realize that was a bridge 
too far.  PCI generation hardware just isn't in the spirit of TempleOS.  It's 
done.  I have not made a huge point of less-is-more but to some degree that's

 Then, I can remove FAT32 and ISO9660.  (I might want to change clusters to

3) Windows burns ISO files to CD/DVD-ROMS.

7) VMware should allow ATAPI to real hardware.

God says...
mischief continually; he soweth discord.

6:15 Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; suddenly shall he be
broken without remedy.

6:16 These six things doth the LORD hate: yea, seven are an
abomination unto him: 6:17 A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands
that shed innocent blood, 6:18 An heart that deviseth wicked
imaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief, 6:19 A false
witness that speaketh lies, and he that soweth discord among brethren.

6:20 My son, keep thy father's commandment, and forsake not the law of
thy mother: 6:21 Bind them continually upon thine heart, and tie them
about thy neck.

6:22 When thou goest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it shall
keep thee; and when thou awakest, it shall talk with thee.

6:23 For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; and reproofs
of instruction are the way of life: 6:24 To keep thee from the evil

I wish the nigger would make a random number site.  If there's justice, soon, 
He will shit himself and I can take pleasure in payback for all the shit He 
did.

Fucken stoopid nigger.

Too stoopit to know he's in big trouble.

God's world is perfectly just.

17:3 And, behold, there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking
with him.

17:4 Then answered Peter, and said unto Jesus, Lord, it is good for us
to be here: if thou wilt, let us make here three tabernacles; one for
thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.

17:5 While he yet spake, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them: and
behold a voice out of the cloud, which said, This is my beloved Son,
in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him.

17:6 And when the disciples heard it, they fell on their face, and
were sore afraid.

17:7 And Jesus came and touched them, and said, Arise, and be not
afraid.

17:8 And when they had lifted up their eyes, they saw no man, save
Jesus only.

21:21 For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way, at the
head of the two ways, to use divination: he made his arrows bright, he
consulted with images, he looked in the liver.

21:22 At his right hand was the divination for Jerusalem, to appoint
captains, to open the mouth in the slaughter, to lift up the voice
with shouting, to appoint battering rams against the gates, to cast a
mount, and to build a fort.

21:23 And it shall be unto them as a false divination in their sight,
to them that have sworn oaths: but he will call to remembrance the
iniquity, that they may be taken.

21:24 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye have made your
iniquity to be remembered, in that your transgressions are discovered,
so that in all your doings your sins do appear; because, I say, that
ye are come to remembrance, ye shall be taken with the hand.

What a psychologist uses is ... check you for honesty and signs of doubt.

The nigger thought I was lying when I said every single electrical engineer 
would laugh his ass off at puppeting a computer mouse to get millisecond 
timing and knowing what the timer would be when the application ran.

Fucken nigger is looking for doubt.  Nigger, you are laughably full of shit.

I'm in a fucken prison with retard niggers.

All the OSDev people are stoopit niggers.

There are no white people anywhere.  I know white people exist.

Psychologists have the lowest SAT scores.  EE's have higher than CS.  Physics 
have tops.

Talking to a psychologist about milliaseconds, microseconds and nannoseconds
is like the nigger woman who wanted to sue for a trillion dollars.

In my reality, every story is written by my doctors for me.

It's getting old, this little prison with nigger OSDev.

Obviously you know my OS boots.  You watched me write it over the last ten 
years.  You saw me drive my car ten years ago.

Could be you're a complete dumb fuck cow that nothing makes an impression on.
 
That's how you fucken seem -- like Sean, my little brother.  Comeplete dumb

You have to make sure the facts agree.  You seem to have perfect memory of

When I was 11, I had my appendix removed.  I said I was hungry.  I thought it

You're not supposed to be hungry.

I had surgery.  If it was not my appendix, no facts would be different, LOL.  
Doctor got paid, everybody happy.
