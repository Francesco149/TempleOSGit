I added a song.  It's very difficult to make a song that doesn't sounds like 
one of my other songs.

BBC has geneticist who says the human Y chromozome is disappearing.  It 
sounded like when a journalist invokes Moore's Law.  I hate that.

There was a story on the lack of Suns spots... and no global warming.

kill him.

25:4 But Festus answered, that Paul should be kept at Caesarea, and
that he himself would depart shortly thither.

25:5 Let them therefore, said he, which among you are able, go down
with me, and accuse this man, if there be any wickedness in him.

25:6 And when he had tarried among them more than ten days, he went
down unto Caesarea; and the next day sitting on the judgment seat
commanded Paul to be brought.

25:7 And when he was come, the Jews which came down from Jerusalem
stood round about, and laid many and grievous complaints against Paul,
which they could not prove.

25:8 While he answered for himself, Neither against the law of the
Jews, neither against the temple, nor yet against Caesar, have I
offended any thing at all.

think I'm gonna do?  I got fucken God to fuck you up.  Of course I'm gonna
get 
God to fuck you up.  CIA will crawl to me and beg forgiveness for SecureBoot.

                                   Demands

When God is manifest to the World and He claims this operating system, 
publically, here's what I want:

1) VMware to again support PC Speaker and provide emulation if no PC Speaker 
is present.

2) Windows and Linux support RedSea file system in place of FAT32 and
ISO9660. 
 Then, I can remove FAT32 and ISO9660.  (About 2,000 lines of blemished
code.) 
 

3) Windows to burn ISO files to CD/DVD-ROMS.  USB memory sticks are not an 
option, so CD/DVD is what we use.

4) No secure boot.  TempleOS is a additional operating system that must be 
used along-side Windows or Linux.  It must dual boot.

5) Mandate to PC manufacturers that ATA/ATAPI PIO must work.

6) PS2 emulated Keyboard and Mouse must work.  The BIOS must enable these.

7) VMware should allow ATAPI to connect real CD/DVD hardware.

8) Perhaps, VMware can enable faster than standard x86 IN/OUT instruction 
timing for ATA/ATAPI PIO, so the bandwidth isn't as bad.

9) VMware and others should list TempleOS as one of the 64-bit operating 
systems.

10) Windows and Linux should support TempleOS .GRA graphics files.  These are 
just right-side-up .BMP files with 8-bit pixs 4-bits of color and 
transparency, with no palette.  Compression comes from the RedSea .Z LZW 
compression.  (Let me know when you want it.)

In other words, all hardware and BIOSes must support TempleOS as a native and 
as a virtual system, dual booted with Windows or Linux.

It would be neat if TempleOS were burned into BIOS ROMs.  My hope is that it 
will be finished and largely unchanging.  I need a good dictionary, first.  
Maybe, we leave the dictionary out.

I do not intend to ever support UEFI.  That monstrocity uses elf and various 
propriatary graphics formats.

I need to finalize RedSea and GRA, before you implement them.  (Minor 
changes.)

Paging is almost not used, but 64-bit mode requires it to be active.  Virtual 
is identity-mapped to physical.  All tasks on all cores use the same page 
table map, just as though all addresses are physical addresses.  2 Meg page 
table entries are used, except the first 2 Meg, which uses 4K page tables 
entries.  Nothing swaps to disk, either.

In TempleOS, the lowest 2 Gig of memory is called the "code heap". 
TempleOS's 
compiler always uses 32-bit signed relative JMP & CALL instructions because 
64-bit CALLs take two instructions.  With signed +/- 32-bit values, code can 
only call a function within 2 Gig distance.  Therefore, TempleOS keeps all 
code in the lowest 2 Gig memory addresses including what would normally be 
called "the kernel".  Two Gig is plenty, don't worry.

You can create new, independent heaps by first allocating mem with 
[C:/Kernel/Mem1a.CPP.Z,408] MemBlksUncachedAlloc() or
[C:/Kernel/Mem1a.CPP.Z,195] MemBlksIndependentAlloc(), then calling 
[C:/Kernel/Mem1c.CPP.Z,42] HeapCtrlBPInit() and, then, using
[C:/Kernel/Mem1b.CPP.Z,376] MAlloc().

Memory allocated by a task will be freed when the task is killed.

Eventually, memory will become fragmented, requiring a reboot.

When God is manifest to the World and He claims this operating system, 
publically, here's what I want:

1) VMware to again support PC Speaker and provide emulation if no PC Speaker 
is present.

2) Windows and Linux support RedSea file system in place of FAT32 and
ISO9660. 
 Then, I can remove FAT32 and ISO9660.  (About 2,000 lines of blemished
code.) 
 

3) Windows to burn ISO files to CD/DVD-ROMS.  USB memory sticks are not an 
option, so CD/DVD is what we use.

4) No secure boot.  TempleOS is a additional operating system that must be 
used along-side Windows or Linux.  It must dual boot.

5) Mandate to PC manufacturers that ATA/ATAPI PIO must work.

6) PS2 emulated Keyboard and Mouse must work.  The BIOS must enable these.

7) VMware should allow ATAPI to connect real CD/DVD hardware.

8) Perhaps, VMware can enable faster than standard x86 IN/OUT instruction 
timing for ATA/ATAPI PIO, so the bandwidth isn't as bad.

9) VMware and others should list TempleOS as one of the 64-bit operating 
systems.

10) Windows and Linux should support TempleOS .GRA graphics files.  These are 
just right-side-up .BMP files with 8-bit pixs 4-bits of color and 
transparency, with no palette.  Compression comes from the RedSea .Z LZW 
compression.  (Let me know when you want it.)

In other words, all hardware and BIOSes must support TempleOS as a native and 
as a virtual system, dual booted with Windows or Linux.

It would be neat if TempleOS were burned into BIOS ROMs.  My hope is that it 
will be finished and largely unchanging.  I need a good dictionary, first.  
Maybe, we leave the dictionary out.

I do not intend to ever support UEFI.  That monstrocity uses elf and various

My operating system is not a general purpose, "conventional" operating system

failure 
is an option -- I don't have to support everything, like 6 monitor surround 
sound with tread-mill input devices -- If I can fail and say, "Won't do 
that..." Then, I can be an order of magnitude simpler from that alone.  I 
won't support bad disk blocks.  Get a new drive.  I won't try to not crash.  
Just reboot like we did with DOS or a C64.  By allowing reboot as normal, 
that's another order of magnitude simpler.  I will just support common
pre-PCI 
devices.  That's two more orders of magnitude saved.  From 50,000,000 we are 
down to 100,000 lines of code.  That's where were are.  And no networking.

The C64 worked fine.  You guys are talking like it would never fly.  Let's 
stop and think.  You have mental blocks -- brain washing -- that would make 
you say a C64 could never have worked and was useless.  How could you
possibly 
use a C64 if it could crash and had all kinds of corner-case bugs?

I don't want to talk to a test engineer.  He doesn't get it.  Put it this way 
-- we have a budget of 100,000 lines of code.  If we cut corners, we can have 
more stuff.  Obviously, we better not negate a byte with 128 and cause an

It is a different philosophy.  We try to be simpler and less tedious, 
splurging on modern technology to make heavenly simple code.  We pull all 
directory-entries for a mask instead of FindFirst FindNext.  We load whole 
files with comression instead of pipes and pieces of files.  This is our 
philosophy.

The RedSea file system does not allow growing files.  Go use Linux.  I have 
tested the operating system and it works well on video games.  That's what 
it's for and screwing around with the computer itself as a toy, like a C64

It's awesome.  It puts integer in 
a 64-bit number and prints it.  It puts decimal portion in a 64-bit number... 
with some leading zeros.  It is really fast and elegant, but it fails if you 
do 50 decimal places for 10 decimal place numbers because 50 overflows the 
64-bit number when extended from 10^-50 all the way up to 10^-10.

This is not okay:

0.0000010000000000000000000000000000

It becomes obvious when you put it in a 64-bit int that that won't work!  LOL

64-bit size, nicely.

not to all tastes and delightfully simple.

Our metric is least lines of code to get the most done, doing what is

I can't tell.  Did the assembler guy call me a liar?

I have a just-in-time HolyC compiler that can be invoked on assembler 
expressions.  If it hits an undefined label, it makes a new label with a spot 
for its value.  In the expression assembly code, it dereferences the spot
that 
is going to have the label's address.  When the day of reconning comes, it 
does a quick check to see if all undefined labels have been met and it 
evaluates the chunk of x86_64 code for that expression.

It counts-up the number of absolute addresses in an expression.  If odd, then 
it makes an entry in the code-patch table used by the loader.  The loader
will 
fix-up that location to hold an absolute address when loaded.

I mostly don't allow ORG.  You are supposed to let the loader place your code 
in a chunk that is MAlloced off of the code heap (lowest 2 Gig addresses).  
The loader will patch it.

I recently added a MODULE_ORG.  Only one such is allowed.  You have no 
business using it.  It can be used to assemble instructions like a debugger 
injecting it in a certain spot in memory.

I normally get scoffers who immediately think I'm lying when I say I made an 
assembler and compiler.  I take great pleasure in telling them, "Just try to 
do 16-bit segmentation with my assembler!"  My assembler does not support 
16-bit code very well.  You have to manually do segment related stuff.  I
only 
need a little 16-bit code, so I did not make my assembler needlessly complex.
