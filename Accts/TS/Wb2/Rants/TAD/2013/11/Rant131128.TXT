for the LORD your God will deliver it into your hand.

8:8 And it shall be, when ye have taken the city, that ye shall set
the city on fire: according to the commandment of the LORD shall ye
do. See, I have commanded you.

8:9 Joshua therefore sent them forth: and they went to lie in ambush,
and abode between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of Ai: but Joshua
lodged that night among the people.

8:10 And Joshua rose up early in the morning, and numbered the people,
and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai.

8:11 And all the people, even the people of war that were with him,
went up, and drew nigh, and came before the city, and pitched on the
north side of Ai: now there was a valley between them and Ai.

8:12 And he took about five thousand men, and set them to lie in
ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the city.

Bruce Schneier

God says...
1:25 And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of
him.

1:26 And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a loud
voice, he came out of him.

1:27 And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among
themselves, saying, What thing is this? what new doctrine is this? for
with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits, and they do
obey him.

1:28 And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region
round about Galilee.

1:29 And forthwith, when they were come out of the synagogue, they
entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.

1:30 But Simon's wife's mother lay sick of a fever, and anon they tell
him of her.

LOL!  Jesus told the spirit to keep his mouth shut, LOL.

In the past, I didn't really trust or like Schneier.  A lot of people were 
drinking the koolaid and saying propaganda -- I thought he was a lightweight 
and was generally disgusted.  That interview seemed honest.

land, to fall by the sword, that our wives and our children should be
a prey? were it not better for us to return into Egypt?  14:4 And they
said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let us return into
Egypt.

14:5 Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly
of the congregation of the children of Israel.

14:6 And Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, which
were of them that searched the land, rent their clothes: 14:7 And they
spake unto all the company of the children of Israel, saying, The
land, which we passed through to search it, is an exceeding good land.

14:8 If the LORD delight in us, then he will bring us into this land,
and give it us; a land which floweth with milk and honey.

14:9 Only rebel not ye against the LORD, neither fear ye the people of
the land; for they are bread for us: their defence is departed from

15:22 And if ye have erred, and not observed all these commandments,
which the LORD hath spoken unto Moses, 15:23 Even all that the LORD
hath commanded you by the hand of Moses, from the day that the LORD
commanded Moses, and henceforward among your generations; 15:24 Then
it shall be, if ought be committed by ignorance without the knowledge
of the congregation, that all the congregation shall offer one young
bullock for a burnt offering, for a sweet savour unto the LORD, with
his meat offering, and his drink offering, according to the manner,
and one kid of the goats for a sin offering.

15:25 And the priest shall make an atonement for all the congregation
of the children of Israel, and it shall be forgiven them; for it is
ignorance: and they shall bring their offering, a sacrifice made by
fire unto the LORD, and their sin offering before the LORD, for their
ignorance: 15:26 And it shall be forgiven all the congregation of the
children of Israel, and the stranger that sojourneth among them;
seeing all the people were in ignorance.

lily work in the porch, four cubits.

7:20 And the chapiters upon the two pillars had pomegranates also
above, over against the belly which was by the network: and the
pomegranates were two hundred in rows round about upon the other
chapiter.

7:21 And he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple: and he set
up the right pillar, and called the name thereof Jachin: and he set up
the left pillar, and called the name thereof Boaz.

7:22 And upon the top of the pillars was lily work: so was the work of
the pillars finished.

other: it was round all about, and his height was five cubits: and a
line of thirty cubits did compass it round about.

the battle, This is the ordinance of the law which the LORD commanded

U0 is void.

U0 * is size 8, but ptr arithmetic is size zero.

Surprisingly, you will use U8 * for generics frequently because arithmetic is 
size one.

The rule on integers signing and unsigning is... use I64 unless it physically 
breaks.  This rule comes from when I cleaned-up and changed everything to I64 
except things that broke.  The logic is, BASIC and such languages have just 
one integer.  It will save you agony of choosing if you just use I64 unless
it 
breaks.  On function args, you probably want I64 because it zero extends or 
sign extends up to 64-bit when fetched.

God says...
are sorrows, and his travail grief; yea, his heart taketh not rest in
the night. This is also vanity.

2:24 There is nothing better for a man, than that he should eat and
drink, and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour. This
also I saw, that it was from the hand of God.

2:25 For who can eat, or who else can hasten hereunto, more than I?
2:26 For God giveth to a man that is good in his sight wisdom, and
knowledge, and joy: but to the sinner he giveth travail, to gather and
to heap up, that he may give to him that is good before God. This also
is vanity and vexation of spirit.

3:1 To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose

kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build
up; 3:4 A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a

  The mini compiler is like the main compiler, except the main compiler's 
lexical analyser removes comments and does

  the parser stage.  See 
[C:/TempleOS/Compiler/ExpParser.CPP.Z,44] PrsExpression(),

-] Mini Compiler
  For this mini compiler, some things you should know about 64-bit asm:

* Putting a 0x48, known as the REX byte, in front of an instruction makes it 
64-bit size.

* "PUSH EAX", "POP EAX" and "XOR EAX,EAX" will behave as 64-bit even without 
REX because the stk is always 64 bit and because the XOR clears the upper 
32-bits.

It is okay in TempleOS to change RAX, RBX, RCX, RDX, R8 and R9 without 
restoring them to their original values.

That program will JIT compile an expression composed of integers and +-*/()

Writing a JIT compiler is easier than writing an AOT compiler.

My binary format is flat machine code that must be patched to fix-up absolute 
addresses.  After the program portion is a table of absolute address offsets 
and import/exports.

I use ATA/ATAPI Port I/O

A hard disk or CDROM is located at traditional IDE port addresses or the BIOS 
has placed them at higher port addresses.

When you recompile the kernel, it asks you for the port addresses of the hard 
drive and which partition to boot from.  When it boots, the bootloader uses 
BIOS 13 42 to load the first stage, after the first stage, the BIOS cannot be 
used for disk access.  The stage1 file must have support for PIO ATA by 
knowing the port number.  It loads stage2 and my OS loads JIT compiled 
scripts.

Kernel.BIN and Compiler.BIN are the two AOT modules made of 50,000 LOC
The other half of the kernel is compiled JIT at boot time.  50,000 LOC.  My 
compiler takes less than a second to compile 50,000 lines of code.

MakeAll compiles Kernel.BIN and Compiler.BIN.  That's the only AOT code in my 
whole operating system.  All tha games and demos are JIT.

There are no OBJ or EXE files.  You run every so it is like being in an IDE 
and pressing F5 to run your code.  It is JIT and very fast.

You do not link across fixed addresses.  Each application in each task is at
a 
different address.  The compiler calls MAlloc() for an address.  The loader 
calls MAlloc() for an address.  They resolve importas and exports and patch 
absolute addresses.

God says...
Joshua and with the children of Israel.

10:5 Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem,
the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king
of Eglon, gathered themselves together, and went up, they and all
their hosts, and encamped before Gibeon, and made war against it.

10:6 And the men of Gibeon sent unto Joshua to the camp to Gilgal,
saying, Slack not thy hand from thy servants; come up to us quickly,
and save us, and help us: for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell
in the mountains are gathered together against us.

10:7 So Joshua ascended from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war
with him, and all the mighty men of valour.

10:8 And the LORD said unto Joshua, Fear them not: for I have
delivered them into thine hand; there shall not a man of them stand
before thee.

10:9 Joshua therefore came unto them suddenly, and went up from Gilgal

Over the last ten years, I have tried my operating system on about 5 
computers.  It did not work at first on 4 of them and I had to make changes.  
I learned a lesson.  When it comes to PC operating systems, "It's 
compatibility stupid!"

The clowns at WWW.OSDEV.ORG haven't figured-out that compatibility is the
only 
thing they should worry about.  You guys have nothing that resembles a
product 
and will never have anything that resembles a product.  I wrote an HD Audio 
Driver.  Only 2 of the 5 machines worked with it.  VMware on the 2 machines 
with HD Audio did not work with HD Audio.  Well, shit!  2 out of 7 
configurations is worthless.  Why am I making my API garbage to support HD 
Audio?  I got rid of HD Audio and swore not to do any PCI devices.  I use
just 
PCI internal speaker and it is beautifully simple.

Guess what?  I got God.  If it is not endoresed by God, it will never amount 
to anything.  If it is endorsed by God, I get to tell all the companies to 
make it work, the same way Microsoft does.

I am simply waiting for God to kick some ass.

It is not in the spirit of TempleOS to support PCI or later hardware.

Interrupts are a major source of shit being incompatible.  If you can operate 
without interrupts, you are ahead of people who can't.  Mine will operate
with 
polling a mouse if necessary.  PCI shit is even worse.  Fuck that.  

God says...
of whom it is witnessed that he liveth.

7:9 And as I may so say, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, payed tithes
in Abraham.

7:10 For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met
him.

7:11 If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for
under it the people received the law,) what further need was there
that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and
not be called after the order of Aaron?  7:12 For the priesthood being
changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law.

7:13 For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another
tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar.

7:14 For it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda; of which
tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood.

Interrupts are a right of passage.  The guys at OSDev are young, "Do you know 
Interrupts?  I do! I do!  I'll bet you don't know interrupts!"  I did 
interrupts in 1985 on my Commodore 64 to switch at a raster line between text 
and graphics modes.  All of us programmers who worked on DOS wrote interrupts 
for COMM and stuff.  Put it this way -- I put an "interrupt" keyword in MY 
FUCKEN COMPILER!

I am in a higher league than you clowns -- I wrote a fucken compiler.  I was, 
literally, a professional operating system developer on Ticketamster's VAX 
operating system in 1990 at age 20 in VAX assembly language.

I had to prove I could do [C:/Demo/Lectures/PCIInterrupts.CPP.Z,1].

Can you pass my [C:/Demo/Lectures/64BitAsmQuiz.TXT.Z,1] Asm Programming Test?
 Sure, everybody know 16-bit asm because 
my whole generation programmed in 16-bit asm back in 1990-1994.  How many of 
you know 64-bit!!  Gotcha.  I wrote a 64-bit assembler and compiler.  I am 
almost the only one on the planet who knows it!

5:2 Then rose up Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son
of Jozadak, and began to build the house of God which is at Jerusalem:
and with them were the prophets of God helping them.

5:3 At the same time came to them Tatnai, governor on this side the
river, and Shetharboznai and their companions, and said thus unto
them, Who hath commanded you to build this house, and to make up this
wall?  5:4 Then said we unto them after this manner, What are the
names of the men that make this building?  5:5 But the eye of their
God was upon the elders of the Jews, that they could not cause them to
cease, till the matter came to Darius: and then they returned answer
by letter concerning this matter.

5:6 The copy of the letter that Tatnai, governor on this side the
river, and Shetharboznai and his companions the Apharsachites, which
were on this side the river, sent unto Darius the king: 5:7 They sent
a letter unto him, wherein was written thus; Unto Darius the king, all
peace.

in the field, saying, When they come out of the city, we shall catch
them alive, and get into the city.

I gotta stop using "nigger".

Earlier, I said task==process==thread.  Technically, tasks have child tasks.  
That is similar to processes having threads.  If a task is killed, it's 
children die.  Child tasks inherit symbols from parents.  That is, it
searches 
their symbol table.  Then, it searches parents' symbol tables.  All tasks are 
children of the Adam Task.  (Adam and Eve)

God says...
6:4 And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was nigh.

6:5 When Jesus then lifted up his eyes, and saw a great company come
unto him, he saith unto Philip, Whence shall we buy bread, that these
may eat?  6:6 And this he said to prove him: for he himself knew what
he would do.

6:7 Philip answered him, Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not
sufficient for them, that every one of them may take a little.

6:8 One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, saith unto
him, 6:9 There is a lad here, which hath five barley loaves, and two
small fishes: but what are they among so many?  6:10 And Jesus said,
Make the men sit down. Now there was much grass in the place. So the
men sat down, in number about five thousand.

6:11 And Jesus took the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he
distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were set
down; and likewise of the fishes as much as they would.

I can save one task's registers and load another task's tegisters 4,000,000 
times a second per core.  Some of my techniques assume, maybe 20 tasks,
total. 
 It would not perform well.  The usage model is that of a C64 -- playing
games 
and tinkering with programming.  People made sprite data in BASIC programs
and 
poked sound, ordinary people.  Playing with the stuff that we now have off 
limits was the entertainment.  We made binary numbers into images by hand.

I copy all 25 meg to my backup

I go through all source code and convert spaces to tabs and remove trailing

I open the editor on all links to see if the links are valid.

I close all tree widgets in all text files.

I copy to backup drive and recompile everything.

LORD said unto thee, Behold, I will deliver thine enemy into thine

David arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul's robe privily.

24:5 And it came to pass afterward, that David's heart smote him,
because he had cut off Saul's skirt.

24:6 And he said unto his men, The LORD forbid that I should do this
thing unto my master, the LORD's anointed, to stretch forth mine hand
against him, seeing he is the anointed of the LORD.

24:7 So David stayed his servants with these words, and suffered them
not to rise against Saul. But Saul rose up out of the cave, and went
on his way.

24:8 David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and cried
after Saul, saying, My lord the king. And when Saul looked behind him,
David stooped with his face to the earth, and bowed himself.

The RedSea file system is like FAT but has only an allocation bitmap with 
contiguous files.

Users will normally load and save whole files, not incremental files.  
Compression only works on whole files, for example.

There is a very rich document infrastructure.  You will use a CDoc as a text 
file in memory that you write-out.

A document is a circular-doubly-linked-list of commands.  One command is
ASCII 
text.  One command is carriage return, soft or hard.  There are commands for 
links and trees and colors and sprite. [C:/TempleOS/Kernel/Adam1a.HPP.Z,1045]
DOCT_TEXT, [C:/Adam/Doc/Doc.CPP.Z,1]

You will use Windows or Linux for enterprise stuff.  You will use templeOS
for 
offerings to God such as animated hymns and games.

Hymn Videos

We are going to order Windows and Linux to support RedSea on hard drive and 
CDROM, so we can eliminate FAT32 and ISO9660.  God's temple must be perfect.

Our reason to exist is to be different and brilliantly simple, now possible 
with modern hardware, like loading and saving whole files.

God says...
4:5 The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh.

4:6 Better is an handful with quietness, than both the hands full with
travail and vexation of spirit.

4:7 Then I returned, and I saw vanity under the sun.

4:8 There is one alone, and there is not a second; yea, he hath
neither child nor brother: yet is there no end of all his labour;
neither is his eye satisfied with riches; neither saith he, For whom
do I labour, and bereave my soul of good? This is also vanity, yea, it
is a sore travail.

4:9 Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their
labour.

4:10 For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him
that is alone when he falleth; for he hath not another to help him up.

4:11 Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but how can one

Windows and TempleOS.

Currently CFile * supports discontiguous incremental files "w+" but will will 
get rid of that, once we get rid of FAT32.

We have a limit of 100,000 lines and we are currently at 83,070.  If we get 
rid of FAT32 and ISO9660 we can save 2,000 lines or more.  They are replaced 
with RedSea and an image of a RedSea partition on a CDROM.

Here are my demands to make of Microsoft, Linux and hardware people. 

                                   Demands

When God is manifest to the World and He claims this operating system, 
publically, here's what I want:

1) VMware to again support PC Speaker and provide emulation if no PC Speaker 
is present.

2) Windows and Linux support RedSea file system in place of FAT32 and
ISO9660. 
 Then, I can remove FAT32 and ISO9660.  (About 2,000 lines of blemished code.
 
God's temple must be perfect and redundant filesystem types is bad.)  

3) Windows to burn ISO files to CD/DVD-ROMS.  USB memory sticks are not an 
option, so CD/DVD is what we use.

4) No secure boot.  TempleOS is a additional operating system that must be 
used along-side Windows or Linux.  It must dual boot.

5) Mandate to PC manufacturers that ATA/ATAPI PIO must work.

6) PS2 emulated Keyboard and Mouse must work.  The BIOS must enable these.

7) VMware should allow ATAPI to connect real CD/DVD hardware.

8) Perhaps, VMware can enable faster than standard x86 IN/OUT instruction 
timing for ATA/ATAPI PIO, so the bandwidth isn't as bad.

9) VMware and others should list TempleOS as one of the 64-bit operating 
systems.

10) Windows and Linux should support TempleOS .GRA graphics files.  These are 
just right-side-up .BMP files with 8-bit pixels 4-bits of color and 
transparency, with no palette.  Compression comes from the RedSea .Z LZW 
compression.  (Let me know when you want it.) 
[C:/TempleOS/Adam/Gr/GrDC.CPP.Z,154] DCSave(),
[C:/TempleOS/Adam/Gr/GrDC.CPP.Z,234] GRAWrite(),
[C:/TempleOS/Adam/Gr/GrDC.CPP.Z,197] DCLoad(), 
and [C:/TempleOS/Adam/Gr/GrDC.CPP.Z,245] GRARead(). 
[C:/Kernel/Compress.CPP.Z,1]

In other words, all hardware and BIOSes must support TempleOS as a native and 
as a virtual system, dual booted with Windows or Linux.

It would be neat if TempleOS were burned into BIOS ROMs.  My hope is that it 
will be finished and largely unchanging.  I need a good dictionary, first.  
Maybe, we leave the dictionary out.

I do not intend to ever support UEFI.  That monstrocity uses elf and various 
propriatary graphics formats.

Actually, I could move them out of the 
counted code into the demos which don't count.

I am NOT worried about resources.  I am worried about preserving the inviting 
smallness to get your head around.

I could use help on thew Graphics code, probably.  I am open to radically 
changing.  I am vexed because I have fixed-point integer code -- the trend is 
to floating, but last I benchmarked, it barely kept afloat.  I have sprites 
that are integer coordinates.  Insane, in some ways.  We could radically redo 
it.

9:1 And Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem unto his
mother's brethren, and communed with them, and with all the family of
the house of his mother's father, saying, 9:2 Speak, I pray you, in
the ears of all the men of Shechem, Whether is better for you, either
that all the sons of Jerubbaal, which are threescore and ten persons,
reign over you, or that one reign over you? remember also that I am

9:3 And his mother's brethren spake of him in the ears of all the men

I know!  We hook a geiger counter up to a keyboard, LOL.  You do it.  Make

No comet, God?  Shucks, I thought it was a sign of the end of the World.

I don't drink alcohol.  It's natural craziness.

I don't smoke pot.  I smoked cigarettes a few years ago.  I like going
outside 
in our garden and listening to the radio.  I'm doing that less.

Praise God for ... cats.

feast.

29:23 And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his
daughter, and brought her to him; and he went in unto her.

29:24 And Laban gave unto his daughter Leah Zilpah his maid for an
handmaid.

29:25 And it came to pass, that in the morning, behold, it was Leah:
and he said to Laban, What is this thou hast done unto me? did not I
serve with thee for Rachel? wherefore then hast thou beguiled me?
29:26 And Laban said, It must not be so done in our country, to give
the younger before the firstborn.

29:27 Fulfil her week, and we will give thee this also for the service
which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years.

29:28 And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week: and he gave him Rachel

Eh?  Radio said a cannibal story caught headlines.  This story is

91:7 A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right

all thy ways.
