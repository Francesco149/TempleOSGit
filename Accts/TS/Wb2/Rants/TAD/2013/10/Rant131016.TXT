17:16 Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred
in him, when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry.

17:17 Therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews, and with
the devout persons, and in the market daily with them that met with
him.

17:18 Then certain philosophers of the Epicureans, and of the Stoicks,
encountered him. And some said, What will this babbler say? other
some, He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods: because he
preached unto them Jesus, and the resurrection.

17:19 And they took him, and brought him unto Areopagus, saying, May
we know what this new doctrine, whereof thou speakest, is?  17:20 For
thou bringest certain strange things to our ears: we would know
therefore what these things mean.

17:21 (For all the Athenians and strangers which were there spent
their time in nothing else, but either to tell, or to hear some new

The horse is the man.  The carriage is the woman.  Men do the action of 
courtship, but women actually make the decision.  It's as though the woman is 
chasing the man, but the man is doing the work.  The man might think he is 
chasing -- it sure seems like it.  And it's at a fixed distance.

The radio talks to me.  Reality is unusual.  At Graphic Technologies, it was 
the Truman Show.  I was red team for the CIA.  I had to counter anti-refill 
chips for printer cartridges and the CIA observed and made it harder, but not 
too hard.  There is some cosmic reason not to make it too hard.  When they do 
encryption, I think they make it so supercomputers can do it, but not too 
hard.  So, Ken was a coworker whom I didn't like.  He broke my high speed 
parallel port card and I couldn't get another.  The CIA banned such cards.  
They do not want high speed digital I/O for PCs.

Everything is controlled by the CIA.  My graphic in my operating system are 
awful.  It's probably the CIA.  I heard a roomer of 57 Ghz chips.

not a fan of whatever magic they do to hide MAlloc().  A liberal wants to 
protect the poor kids from the brutal world of ones and zeros of MAlloc() and 
pointers.  Guess what?  Now, you have two problems and a clusterfucked thing 
you will eventually have to explain.

Lots of evil comes from liberals wanting to protect young minds from... the 
real way things work.  They are "proud of heart".

I don't really advocate this, but you could teach 6502 assembly language as
an 
introduction to computers in 8th grade.  It's not complicated -- it's simple.
 
It's so simple it's complicated.

It seems like people got the scent of "protect young minds from the real way 
it's done."  Now, there is a stampede of people jumping on the band wagon of 
ever-more protecting the young people from the way it's really done.

I have a feeling it's FUBAR.  Fucked-up beyond all recognition.  Good 
intentions -- treating all kids as black and unable to learn.  The liberals.

Sometimes, I actually think Bill Gates is an evil fucker, quite honestly. 
"Oh 
you don't need to learn that, as he fills minds with poisoned warped shit
that 
will cripple them."

You know?  A spread-sheet is an unnatural construct.

Functional programming is unnatural.

SQL is pretty unnatural.  (It's necessary, though.)

The best word for these is "convoluted" and contrary to normal sequenced 
thought.

I did a report generator for Ticketmaster.  You had to do convoluted 
constructs.

The poor business people who are not programmers have to learn spread sheets 
or whatever -- some nasty unnatural language.

I feel sorry for them, but I guess we can't teach them natural programming 
earlier.

Zuckerberg want everyone to learn to program.  Yeah, I was young and thought 
that.  Now, I don't think that, I guess.

God says...
1:38 So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son
of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, went down, and
caused Solomon to ride upon king David's mule, and brought him to
Gihon.

1:39 And Zadok the priest took an horn of oil out of the tabernacle,
and anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet; and all the people
said, God save king Solomon.

1:40 And all the people came up after him, and the people piped with
pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth rent with the
sound of them.

1:41 And Adonijah and all the guests that were with him heard it as
they had made an end of eating. And when Joab heard the sound of the
trumpet, he said, Wherefore is this noise of the city being in an
uproar?  1:42 And while he yet spake, behold, Jonathan the son of
Abiathar the priest came; and Adonijah said unto him, Come in; for
thou art a valiant man, and bringest good tidings.

Most integers, it's obvious if it's signed or unsigned.  Many, however, could 
go either way.  A prissy faggot will agonize over it.  I saved him the
trouble 
-- use I64 unless it breaks.

Sometimes, a king solves everything.

Tabs are 8 characters.

I did a regulator for wall voltage.  I was going to put a potentiometer in it 
to calibrate it.  My boss said not to.  I had to work really hard to
eliminate 
an indecision.

When I first did my operating system installation, I prompted for I/O port
for 
ATA/ATAPI.  Then, I tried to get rid of asking the user a question.  It is a 
monumental amount of work and I didn't quite get it done.... just so the user 
doesn't have to be bothered.

I think Apple understands simplicity.  I have deep respect.  Little things
can 
take a lot of work to simplify.  I don't always choose simplicity.

My operating system is not minimal.  I have crazy indulgences.  I have a 
differential equation engine... kinda crazy.  I picked HolyC instead of
BASIC. 
 Fuck BASIC.  I might allow BASIC if Gates wants to do it himself, it'd be 
kinda cool to give him the honor.


I don't have minimal as a guiding law.  It's whatever makes me happy.  I do 
want the whole thing small, though.  I don't want it growing.

Words cannot express how evil this song is.

Simple Man

A young mind can latch-onto a moral compass like "Simple Man" and run with
it. 
 That's an evil moral compass -- begging for a lobotomy.  I suggest "Bring 
glory to God" as your moral compass.  The Bible even says Satan is glorious.

27:57 When the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathaea,

Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body
to be delivered.

27:59 And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean
linen cloth, 27:60 And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn
out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the
sepulchre, and departed.

27:61 And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting over
against the sepulchre.

27:62 Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation, the
chief priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate, 27:63 Saying,
Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive,
After three days I will rise again.

I chose one highlighting color scheme.  You don't need to customize colors -- 
quit-it.

When I'm in a nasty mood, I say you should be a nomad.  That means you can 
pick-up and move from machine to machine.  If you don't customize shit, it's 
easier, but that might be too warlike and Spartan.

The philosophy is, however, that everyone get used to one-key back-ups.  
Instead of not ever getting corrupted, we make reinstall easy.  It's really 
neat having total piece of mind and confidence with full-back-ups in 30 
seconds.   Or whatever.  I'm speaking of VMware, mostly, but I really want to 
move toward Native installs.   It's just... better.  Come-on!

I thought Gates would be tickled to do BASIC, if He understood it to be God's 
Temple in the same way Solomon's Temple was God's Temple.  I don't care.  I 
don't even care if we have BASIC or not.  I don't know.

In theory, BASIC is for beginners.  Most people might just say to jump into 
HolyC.  It's hard to remember what it's like being a beginner.

Those of us old people who grew-up with technology learned in a unique way
and 
the path to our understanding might have been eliminated.

Some people don't want to ruin young minds with GOTO.  An entire generation 
used GOTO and it didn't do any harm.  There can sometimes be outrage at silly 
stuff.  Just remember how much stuff we all learned and set aside... that 
didn't do us any harm.  We learned a whole lots of stuff that would seem a 
distraction.

I asked God about Gates' charities.  God said Gates might like earthquake 
prediction.

I give to charity -- 10% tithe.  There's no rational way to choose.  LOL  You 
can give to United States poor or to World poor.  I give to Audobon, LOL.

It strikes me that we should love our friends more than our enemies.  It
seems 
a perversion, like homosexuality, to love enemies MORE than friends.

You might give to the poorest... but it can't be good not to help Americans
by 
some logic.

I certainly don't no, but I thought I would share my notion that we should 
love friends more than enemies.

I'm very proud that I understand "proud of heart" really well.  Don't be
proud 
of heart.  Jesus was humble of heart and got killed 'cause he accepted

in perfume.  300 days wages.

came unto the valley of Eshcol, and searched it out.

commandment of the LORD your God: 1:27 And ye murmured in your tents,
and said, Because the LORD hated us, he hath brought us forth out of
the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to
destroy us.

I bring good news.  I just find myself fighting with demons and it brings-out 
the worst in me.  I get really preoccupied with the fight and say bad stuff.  
Those fuckers try to grieve me with any guilt they can find.  Evil fuckers.

Once you get used to my sickness... I can probably relax.

The Audobon was not for any particular reason.  I want to give to zoos and 
telescopes.  Zoos seem like they bring glory to God -- cause lots of His 
people to praise Him.  He has not shown any sign He's touched by my gesture.  
God does not purr.

A guy suggested asking God what to do in Washington.  I think what has to be 
accepted is lots of times there are no good answers or it would be easy to 
decide.

Here's what ya do!  God does equal exchange of offering and response.  If you 
senators really want God's help, praise Him or do a hymn or something. 
You'll 
get equal value.  Depressing, LOL.  That's probably worthless, isn't it, if 
the solution is valued in billions.  Who knows how this works, though.

This is not my habit, but many people in the Bible made vows to trade God for 
stuff.  You really have to bargain with God.

In Nineva when Jonah spoke, all the people put-on sackcloth and ashes and 
fasted.

I'll do a poem.

Can't think of any poems.

Absurd misplaced logic feels weird.  Can you exchange completely off topic

down the net.

fishes: and their net brake.

5:7 And they beckoned unto their partners, which were in the other
ship, that they should come and help them. And they came, and filled
both the ships, so that they began to sink.

5:8 When Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying,
Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord.

5:9 For he was astonished, and all that were with him, at the draught
of the fishes which they had taken: 5:10 And so was also James, and
John, the sons of Zebedee, which were partners with Simon. And Jesus
said unto Simon, Fear not; from henceforth thou shalt catch men.
