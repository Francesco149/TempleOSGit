Most people think Brave New World is ghastly, but it's actually Christian!  I 
think all the people who want to be God and kill stupid people should just 
chill-out and meditate on Brave New World.  There is more to life than IQ.  
When humans breed dogs, there's a species of purebreds that is deaf!  Race 
horses have weak legs.  A liberal thought I actually like is... "Humans are 
not anygood at breeding -- leave it to God."  It's okay if God does natural 
selection, but I really don't want humans doing it.  God wants human 
evolution, you can count on it.  God can even do conception mutations and 
match-making, causing evolution with no pain!

I sat and pondered evolution of milk consumption in humans.  Do you realize 
you have to basically kill everybody except one pair just to get something 
like that universal?  Am I wrong?  Each of these universal traits in humans 
must happen one at a time almost where that trait is the only one selected 
where, everybody but one pair dies.  (Not literally, but something like that!
 
It's a mutation from one person and becomes universal!)

You have proven God does not exist, geniuses, now prove He does.  Go prove 
evolution could not happen because the probabilities are absurd.  Obviously, 
it did happen, but God really exists.  Truth is... well...  evolution
probably 
requires God!  Seriously.  As weird as that is... evolution requires God.

If God is manifest and He claims this operating system, here's what I'm going 
to demand:

1) VMware again supports PC Speaker and provides emulation if no PC Speaker.

2) Windows and Linux support RedSea file system in place of FAT32 and
ISO9660. 
 Then, I can remove FAT32 and ISO9660.  (I might want to change clusters to 
just blocks on RedSea.)

3) Windows burns ISO files to CD/DVD-ROMS.

4) No secure boot.

5) ATA/ATAPI PIO must work

6) PS2 emulated Keyboard and Mouse must work

7) VMware should allow ATAPI to real hardware.

8) Can VMware do faster than correct IN/OUT instruction timing for ATA/ATAPI? 
PIO?

I am not stuck.  I am done.  I have capped the line count at 100,000.  Look
on 
the wallpaper after boot.  It says about 50,000 lines have been compiled.  
Then, compile the kernel+compiler.  The total is about 98,000.

If we remove FAT32 and ISO9660, we can add more stuff.  God's temple must be 
perfect.  In a perfect world you have one file system type and one driver for 
each kind of device.  You do not have multiple drivers.

Maybe, Carmack can improve the graphics code, but I really want a firm
100,000 
line count limit.

If you see ways to improve and lower line count, email me.  Maybe, this will 
be like Knuth's books.  That's my vision, more or less, for God's perfect 
Temple.

The vision is closer to a Commodore 64 ROM than Linux.

An abstraction layer is like a condom.  People preach that you should have 
three or more condoms.  The people preaching work on kernels, themselves.  
Bruce Schneider and the other retard niggers will tell you, the more condoms 
the better--they drink the koolaid.  It's rediculous that that cow writes a 
column.  There is not one person in the media as smart as the stupidest
person 
at Ticketmaster.  It's all nausiating brainwashing from one angle or another.

and toward her son, and toward her daughter, 28:57 And toward her
young one that cometh out from between her feet, and toward her
children which she shall bear: for she shall eat them for want of all
things secretly in the siege and straitness, wherewith thine enemy
shall distress thee in thy gates.

28:58 If thou wilt not observe to do all the words of this law that
are written in this book, that thou mayest fear this glorious and
fearful name, THE LORD THY GOD; 28:59 Then the LORD will make thy
plagues wonderful, and the plagues of thy seed, even great plagues,
and of long continuance, and sore sicknesses, and of long continuance.

28:60 Moreover he will bring upon thee all the diseases of Egypt,
which thou wast afraid of; and they shall cleave unto thee.

28:61 Also every sickness, and every plague, which is not written in
the book of this law, them will the LORD bring upon thee, until thou
be destroyed.

11:30 For as Jonas was a sign unto the Ninevites, so shall also the
Son of man be to this generation.

11:31 The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the
men of this generation, and condemn them: for she came from the utmost
parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a

11:34 And Jephthah came to Mizpeh unto his house, and, behold, his
daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances: and she
was his only child; beside her he had neither son nor daughter.

11:35 And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his clothes,
and said, Alas, my daughter! thou hast brought me very low, and thou
art one of them that trouble me: for I have opened my mouth unto the
LORD, and I cannot go back.

11:36 And she said unto him, My father, if thou hast opened thy mouth
unto the LORD, do to me according to that which hath proceeded out of
thy mouth; forasmuch as the LORD hath taken vengeance for thee of
thine enemies, even of the children of Ammon.
