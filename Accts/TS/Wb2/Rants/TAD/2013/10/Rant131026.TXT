they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned.

11:16 But now they desire a better country, that is, an heavenly:
wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he hath
prepared for them a city.

11:17 By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he
that had received the promises offered up his only begotten son, 11:18
Of whom it was said, That in Isaac shall thy seed be called: 11:19
Accounting that God was able to raise him up, even from the dead; from
whence also he received him in a figure.

11:20 By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come.

11:21 By faith Jacob, when he was a dying, blessed both the sons of
Joseph; and worshipped, leaning upon the top of his staff.

 I also have an exponential.  I changed bitwise and and or, too.  Mine is 
better.

Somebody do a program to analyse a bunch of C code and see what the proper 
precidence should be, in practice.  (The one with least parens need is best.)

My precidence is definitely best for the way I program.  Stupid programmers

The 100,000 lines of code limit is firm.

Do you understand what "Trivial Solutions" means?  It's like when Russians 
used pencils and NASA made a space pen.

I have a round-robin task scheduler, no priorities.  It's beautiful.
It does not break disk tasks in pieces, so you really notice your task is 
stuck when waiting for the disk when another task is using the disk doing a 
big file.

We aim to be a C64, not a main frame.  The focus task is all important.

We do have multitasking, if you are playing a song or something in a video 
game or an animation task that makes animation happen.

Picture this:  Mostly we are aiming for a full-screen video game running, not 
really using the disk.  I don't like playing multimedia movies and recordings 
in games.  I don't like that.

I told you to draw an elephant.  You can use 16 color or you can use 24-bit

meshes it's lots of work.  When people come to the temple to do their

There is only one thing that matters for a PC operating system.  
Compatibility.  There are just two operating systems -- Linux and Windows.  
Haiku etc are nonviable.

Mine is viable, but limited to being an auxiliary operating system.

I discovered one of four native machines did not have mouse interrupt firing.
 
I made mine able to poll and not use mouse.  Don't worry, once every 
millisecond it takes about 2 microseconds to check.  It's wasting about 1 
thousandth of the CPU power to poll the mouse.

The cocky little fucks mock not using interrupts.  It's compatibility,
stupid. 
 That's why I win and you lose.  Mine is viable.


If God is manifest and He claims this operating system, here's what I want:

2) Windows and Linux support RedSea file system in place of FAT32 and

 Then, I can remove FAT32 and ISO9660.  (I might want to change clusters to 
just blocks on RedSea.)

3) Windows burns ISO files to CD/DVD-ROMS.

4) No secure boot.

5) ATA/ATAPI PIO must work

6) PS2 emulated Keyboard and Mouse must work

7) VMware should allow ATAPI to real hardware.

8) Can VMware do faster than correct IN/OUT instruction timing for ATA/ATAPI?

At Ticketmaster all of our hardware devices had our bare-metal code.  When
you

a 
professional operating system developer for 25 years.  It is routine.  The

him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art
northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward: 13:15 For all
the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for
ever.

13:16 And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a
man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be
numbered.

13:17 Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the
breadth of it; for I will give it unto thee.

That's about random number seeds and songs.  Mine is timer, not seed, by the 
way.

Songs are very very countable, but there's enough.

I don't really want to do any programming.  If I get started on something
fun, 
it's fun.  In a sane world, the next thing would be a hellish nightmare for
me 
-- feedback on bugs.  "It doesn't boot!"  In VMware it's guarenteed to boot.  
I want people to have the option of native install.  I'm not going to force 
the issue.

You know the ObamaCare problem?  On Leno, Obama said, "I'm guessing bubble 
sort is not right."  Tell him to say, "Just do another abstraction layer."

The is something evil about keeping people ignorant... of computers.  Many 
programmers try to do obsfucation.  The CIA teaches bad on purpose.  

We hold these truths to be self evident... that self evident understanding is 
more self evident and better.  It is better to run TempleOS natively... if
you 
are a nerd male between 13 and 80.  You can take great satisfaction in know 
wht the fuck is happening.  Abstraction layers like VMware deprive man of 
self-evident understanding.

23:13 Then David and his men, which were about six hundred, arose and
departed out of Keilah, and went whithersoever they could go. And it
was told Saul that David was escaped from Keilah; and he forbare to go
forth.

23:14 And David abode in the wilderness in strong holds, and remained
in a mountain in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him every
day, but God delivered him not into his hand.

23:15 And David saw that Saul was come out to seek his life: and David
was in the wilderness of Ziph in a wood.

23:16 And Jonathan Saul's son arose, and went to David into the wood,
and strengthened his hand in God.

23:17 And he said unto him, Fear not: for the hand of Saul my father
shall not find thee; and thou shalt be king over Israel, and I shall
be next unto thee; and that also Saul my father knoweth.

23:18 And they two made a covenant before the LORD: and David abode in

This is evil.  Simple Man

God damn, that is the evilest song.  "Please give me a lobotomy!"  Fucken 
Catholics.  Glorify God.  Do not insult Satan because God made Him.

Anyway, I am not preaching "do this shitty thing like be poor."  Once you 
understand the issues, I'll leave it to you.

TempleOS is not a charity that needs God's ordering.  It's awesome.

You'll want to talk with God.  Drawing a fucken 24-bit color elephant is for 
artists.

The natural view on purpose of life is to reproduce.
The true purpose of life is to entertain God.

God used the word "vain".

A vain person looks in the mirror and says, "Damn I have a high IQ."

6:5 And I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom
the Egyptians keep in bondage; and I have remembered my covenant.

6:6 Wherefore say unto the children of Israel, I am the LORD, and I
will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will
rid you out of their bondage, and I will redeem you with a stretched
out arm, and with great judgments: 6:7 And I will take you to me for a
people, and I will be to you a God: and ye shall know that I am the
LORD your God, which bringeth you out from under the burdens of the
Egyptians.

6:8 And I will bring you in unto the land, concerning the which I did
swear to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give
it you for an heritage: I am the LORD.

6:9 And Moses spake so unto the children of Israel: but they hearkened
not unto Moses for anguish of spirit, and for cruel bondage.

Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel go out of

I feel odd because I like elephants.  Republicans have elephants.  It's not 
good that people think Republicans when I talk about elephants.  That is not 
what I want them to think about -- it's a distraction.

Life is a journey, not just a destination.  If you find yourself enraptured
in 
a compelling thing, that's Heaven.  If God tells you a riddle, that's Heaven.
 
what were you expecting?  Just think -- for an hour today, you were fully 
engaged in a neato thought.  That's as good as it gets.  Think about it. 
Look 
at your life and make a note of the times when you are happy.  I think they 
balance.  The low times are better than nothing, except some times.  Look at 
life as a series of highs and lows.  Every now and then take note that you
are 
in an up mood and think about it being as good as it gets and be satisfied.  
God's company is Heaven.  He carries-on nice conversation.

Don't worry you're going to miss-out.  Highs and lows balance.

merciful men are taken away, none considering that the righteous is

one walking in his uprightness.

57:3 But draw near hither, ye sons of the sorceress, the seed of the
adulterer and the whore.

57:4 Against whom do ye sport yourselves? against whom make ye a wide
mouth, and draw out the tongue? are ye not children of transgression,
a seed of falsehood.

the children in the valleys under the clifts of the rocks?  57:6 Among
