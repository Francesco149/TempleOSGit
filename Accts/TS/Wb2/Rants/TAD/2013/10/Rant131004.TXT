sister is not under bondage in such cases: but God hath called us to
peace.

7:16 For what knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy
husband?  or how knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt save thy
wife?  7:17 But as God hath distributed to every man, as the Lord hath
called every one, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all churches.

7:18 Is any man called being circumcised? let him not become
uncircumcised. Is any called in uncircumcision? let him not be
circumcised.

7:19 Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the
keeping of the commandments of God.

7:20 Let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called.

7:21 Art thou called being a servant? care not for it: but if thou
mayest be made free, use it rather.

China has monster hornets.

I have back pains.

Sucks.

For the rest of my life, I will always border on back pains.

Monster hornets, sucks.

At least they don't make you zombies.  LOL

Points-out lots of people were eager to work on the temple.

You kinda gotta live with fuzzy.

God speaks in whispers?

You like Chinese flutes, God?

God says...
Jehoshaphat, saying, Because thou hast joined thyself with Ahaziah,
the LORD hath broken thy works. And the ships were broken, that they
were not able to go to Tarshish.

21:1 Now Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his
fathers in the city of David. And Jehoram his son reigned in his
stead.

21:2 And he had brethren the sons of Jehoshaphat, Azariah, and Jehiel,
and Zechariah, and Azariah, and Michael, and Shephatiah: all these
were the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel.

21:3 And their father gave them great gifts of silver, and of gold,
and of precious things, with fenced cities in Judah: but the kingdom
gave he to Jehoram; because he was the firstborn.

21:4 Now when Jehoram was risen up to the kingdom of his father, he
strengthened himself, and slew all his brethren with the sword, and
divers also of the princes of Israel.

fuzzy entertaining nonsense.  God talks, but just for fun.

I did not do Chinese characters.

China's got hornets, Japan's got Fukishima!

They were talking about Chenoble.

A rational person would ask God what to do with waste.

I'm a pessimist -- you only get love, nothing useful.

You like to make new radiation animals, God?

God says...
10:18 To judge the fatherless and the oppressed, that the man of the
earth may no more oppress.

11:1 In the LORD put I my trust: how say ye to my soul, Flee as a bird
to your mountain?

11:2 For, lo, the wicked bend their bow, they make ready their arrow
upon the string, that they may privily shoot at the upright in heart.

11:3 If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do?

11:4 The LORD is in his holy temple, the LORD's throne is in heaven:
his eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men.

11:5 The LORD trieth the righteous: but the wicked and him that loveth
violence his soul hateth.

MIT Robots

That really made me think!  My head exploded!

God is the god of the Bible.  He's a good guy.

I lost enthusiasm for artificial intelligence -- partially nightmares, also, 
no ideas I'm dying to try.

I made a crappy 3-axis steppermoter 3D printer/dremel.  No longer interested 
in robots.

My operating system is obnoxiously simple, but powerful.

You guys might be suffering fear!  

I did not create God.  God is the God of the Bible.

My operating system is like a souped-up, modern Commodore 64.  In my mind, I 
have done everything you can do with it, and I'm closer to finished playing 
with it...  I grew-up and I'm not interested in video games.  I'm interested 
in God.

I'm having tons and tons of neat thoughts inspired by the module robots.

Leibnitz, a philosopher, thought reality was particles preprogrammed, kinda 
like those blocks.

My operating system is not modular.  If others wanted to help by making 
modules... no this is like a C64 with a standard issue ROM -- you will not 
build on it.

Maybe, you think I'm isolated and God is a virus.  Maybe, you think God has 
nanobots.

There are lots of rational fears, but God is the God of the Bible.

Angels sure are busy -- unnerving.  Spirits are beings (angels) who can
puppet 
people.
