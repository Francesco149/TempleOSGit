days of thy life: 3:15 And I will put enmity between thee and the
woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head,
and thou shalt bruise his heel.

3:16 Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and
thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy
desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.

3:17 And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice
of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee,
saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake;
in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life; 3:18 Thorns
also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the
herb of the field; 3:19 In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread,
till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for
dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.

Hymn Videos

Do a text search for "new song" in the bible.  Happens like 9 times.

Do an offering of a hymn -- God likes that.  I get Him to make the melody and 
Him to provide a one word title.  It's pretty easy, then.  No writer's block.

It's hilarious how tunnel-vision your mind will be if you sit down to write a 
hymn without a random word for the title.

This guy who did compiler thing...

My compiler works JIT, really easily.  It is recursive -- my compiler calls 
itself.  It compiles assembler expressions to machine code and when my 
assembler has an expression with a undefined value, it defines a symbol and 
codes a indirect reference in the machine code for the expression.  At the 
end, it processes all the expressions which had undefined values and
evaluates 
them and patches all referrences to them.  The indirections look-up the newly 
defined value and the expression result is accurate.

If there are an odd number of absolute addresses, it makes a table entry in 
the BIN header to tell the loader to add an absolute address to the number.  
If there are an even number of absolute addresses (label2-label1) it does not 
tell it to add an absolute.

My compiler generates unoptimized INTERMEDIATE code.  It makes several 
evaluation passes through the code to simplify constant expressions and 
optimize.

Did I mention God talks and I'm the best programmer on the planet, chosen to 
make His temple and He gives me divine intellect?  FUCK YOU!

There are cases where it needs to fetch an absolute address into a variable.

Look at the bottom: [C:/Kernel/Interrupts.CPP.Z,2] SYS_MP_CRASH_HANDLER_ADDR

That required a kludge.  It stores the address in a mem location and fetches 
it.

born among you, and thou shalt love him as thyself; for ye were
strangers in the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.

19:35 Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in meteyard, in

19:36 Just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin, shall

Egypt.

19:37 Therefore shall ye observe all my statutes, and all my

ephod to David.

30:8 And David enquired at the LORD, saying, Shall I pursue after this
troop? shall I overtake them? And he answered him, Pursue: for thou
shalt surely overtake them, and without fail recover all.

30:9 So David went, he and the six hundred men that were with him, and
came to the brook Besor, where those that were left behind stayed.

30:10 But David pursued, he and four hundred men: for two hundred
abode behind, which were so faint that they could not go over the
brook Besor.

30:11 And they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to
David, and gave him bread, and he did eat; and they made him drink
water; 30:12 And they gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and two
clusters of raisins: and when he had eaten, his spirit came again to
him: for he had eaten no bread, nor drunk any water, three days and
three nights.

have commanded thee, and wilt keep my statutes and my judgments: 9:5
Then I will establish the throne of thy kingdom upon Israel for ever,
as I promised to David thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a
man upon the throne of Israel.

9:6 But if ye shall at all turn from following me, ye or your
children, and will not keep my commandments and my statutes which I
have set before you, but go and serve other gods, and worship them:
9:7 Then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given
them; and this house, which I have hallowed for my name, will I cast
out of my sight; and Israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all
people: 9:8 And at this house, which is high, every one that passeth
by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss; and they shall say, Why
hath the LORD done thus unto this land, and to this house?  9:9 And
they shall answer, Because they forsook the LORD their God, who
brought forth their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and have taken
hold upon other gods, and have worshipped them, and served them:
therefore hath the LORD brought upon them all this evil.

nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all; 4:2 But is under
tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father.

4:3 Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the
elements of the world: 4:4 But when the fulness of the time was come,
God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law, 4:5 To
redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the
adoption of sons.

4:6 And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son
into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.

4:7 Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son; and if a son,
then an heir of God through Christ.

4:8 Howbeit then, when ye knew not God, ye did service unto them which
by nature are no gods.

dealt thus with us, to carry us forth out of Egypt?  14:12 Is not this
the word that we did tell thee in Egypt, saying, Let us alone, that we
may serve the Egyptians? For it had been better for us to serve the
Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness.
