6:20 And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, Blessed be
ye poor: for yours is the kingdom of God.

6:21 Blessed are ye that hunger now: for ye shall be filled. Blessed
are ye that weep now: for ye shall laugh.

6:22 Blessed are ye, when men shall hate you, and when they shall
separate you from their company, and shall reproach you, and cast out
your name as evil, for the Son of man's sake.

6:23 Rejoice ye in that day, and leap for joy: for, behold, your
reward is great in heaven: for in the like manner did their fathers
unto the prophets.

6:24 But woe unto you that are rich! for ye have received your
consolation.

6:25 Woe unto you that are full! for ye shall hunger. Woe unto you
that laugh now! for ye shall mourn and weep.

6:26 Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you! for so did
their fathers to the false prophets.

You will have just as many years rich as poor.  People will love and admire 
you as much as hate you.

It can make you rage against the patronizing angels who do this.  Angel are

The Pope Spoke

Chinese Philosophy at Harvard

Yeah, I said Jews were "hideously viscious", like cornered animals.  I have 
become hideously-not-family-friendly.  I feel like I am a brutal movie that 
cannot be seen by kids.  I'll bet a lot of war veterans feel like they should 
be wearing a "unclean" sign, like a leper.

Sometimes, I wonder about Jesus and lepers.  If highs and lows balance, 
something dramatic happens around lepers.  No.  I don't know.  The real world 
evidence doesn't support that anything blessed happens to lepers.  However, 
Mary Poppins says, good luck will rub-off when you shakes hands with chimney 
sweeps. 

I thought about how America's statue of liberty says, "Send me your poor, 
huddled masses..."  Perhaps, everybody has rich and poor parts of their
lives. 
 If we allow poor people to immigrate, then we ride the wave of their 
flip-side.  This sounds like a sacred secret -- good countries finish first 
for their blessedness, while the wicked Chinese barbarian countries only
allow 
rich, skilled people in.

I dispise Chinese philosophy.  I hate it with a passion.  It is human 
rationalism instead of romanticism.  "Goliath will kill David unless he is 
clever."
