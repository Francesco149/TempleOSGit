Let's ask God to draw a dinosaur.

I'll do a poem:


The mighty T-Rex sniffs the air.
Brontosaurs, somewhere, somewhere.
Thunder lizard paws the ground.
Thunder lizard now outbound.

Sniffs the left. Sniffs the right.
Thunder lizard, viscious fight.
Flesh to eat.  Flesh to eat.
Her young don't need a teat.

God says...

God says...

How about God draws a stealth fighter or a space ship?  Come-on God!

It's a duck.

I'll do a peom:

Duck is master of land, sea, air.
Duck's got feathers, don't need no hair.
Umm, quack sir.  Quack please move.
Ain't no cow, aint got no hoove.

God says...

Pet birds are toys, no batteries required.
On seeds they feed and never get tired.
They chirp, they flutter, and totally cheap.
I like mine, I'm gonna keep.
