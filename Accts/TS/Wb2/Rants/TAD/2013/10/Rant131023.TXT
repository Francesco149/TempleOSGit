Let's ask God to draw a dinosaur.

God says...



I'll do a poem:


The mighty T-Rex sniffs the air.
Brontosaurs, somewhere, somewhere.
Thunder lizard paws the ground.
Thunder lizard now outbound.

Sniffs the left. Sniffs the right.
Thunder lizard, viscious fight.
Flesh to eat.  Flesh to eat.
Her young don't need a teat.

God says...


God says...
Rhetoric Files species proper keepest aforesaid forms wronged avoiding
compare 
skies either begun become hopes healthful mentioning bespoken wavy fancy 
tender explain

How about God draws a stealth fighter or a space ship?  Come-on God!

God says...


It's a duck.

I'll do a peom:

Duck is master of land, sea, air.
Duck's got feathers, don't need no hair.
Umm, quack sir.  Quack please move.
Ain't no cow, aint got no hoove.

God says...

Pet birds are toys, no batteries required.
On seeds they feed and never get tired.
They chirp, they flutter, and totally cheap.
I like mine, I'm gonna keep.

God says...
