I saw this article about genius.

I saw a Crack Pot.

How about I do a poem:

----
The mind it thinks its thoughts.
Do as you think you oughts.
When zeroed-in,
dance on a pin,
do more than what you're taughts.

That's a computer that doubles as a head.  LOL


My poem was an attempt at double meanings.  God likes that.  God doesn't like 
dumb stuff.  When doing double meanings, something has to give.  My poem 
doesn't make good sense.

I think poetry can be like tongues when you push your limits.

I was referencing zero/ought which kinda suggest soullessness.  I'm not
really 
sure, but when people talk of a soul, it sounds like a crack-pot.

We do, however, get inspired by angels or God and do better than we could on 
our own.

What do You think, God?

4:7 Then she came and told the man of God. And he said, Go, sell the
oil, and pay thy debt, and live thou and thy children of the rest.

4:8 And it fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where was a
great woman; and she constrained him to eat bread. And so it was, that
as oft as he passed by, he turned in thither to eat bread.

4:9 And she said unto her husband, Behold now, I perceive that this is
an holy man of God, which passeth by us continually.

4:10 Let us make a little chamber, I pray thee, on the wall; and let
us set for him there a bed, and a table, and a stool, and a
candlestick: and it shall be, when he cometh to us, that he shall turn
in thither.

4:11 And it fell on a day, that he came thither, and he turned into
the chamber, and lay there.

That kinda funny.  2 Kings 4.

Some suggests I edit: 
Story:We had to edit.

If God responds to something crappy, it's not crappy.  God liked my awful,
but 
trippy, poem more than my bird painting.  I'm not a distinguished artist and 
it was stupid.

God doesn't like my drumming.  I guess I'm not a good drummer.

Where on Earth can He get awful, but trippy poems?  Just me!  I'm the best 
awful-but-trippy poem writer, LOL.

Older people are likely to cut-somebody-off when talking.  There are many 
thoughts I had when younger and, now, I scorn them.  Why?

They say God must be unfathomable.  That's an odd thing.  When a psychologist 
lays-bare a human mind with it's motivations, that diminishes the person -- 
makes them look small.

It annoys me when I hear a young person say something I once thought.  One
can 
actually get contrary and attack all thought we had as youth... just because.

"Everybody should be a programmer," is an example.

"If I multi-task in life, my brain will get bigger."

Some Chinese woman fed her kids cows brains.  LOL

A lot of people want to "hack" increasing their intelligence.  I groan when I 
hear stupid stuff I once thought.

I hate all the thoughts from my athiest years.  LOL

21:10 And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in Oboth.

21:11 And they journeyed from Oboth, and pitched at Ijeabarim, in the
wilderness which is before Moab, toward the sunrising.

21:12 From thence they removed, and pitched in the valley of Zared.

21:13 From thence they removed, and pitched on the other side of
Arnon, which is in the wilderness that cometh out of the coasts of the
Amorites: for Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the
Amorites.

21:14 Wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of the LORD, What
he did in the Red sea, and in the brooks of Arnon, 21:15 And at the
stream of the brooks that goeth down to the dwelling of Ar, and lieth
upon the border of Moab.

The radio had a punter.  That's about a pitcher.  LOL

When I see "MOAB", I always check to see if it means, "Mother of all
battles", 
but it never does.  On one day, a story will make sense in one way and make 
sense in a different way on another day.

I thought the physician snakes came from this story, but I think it's some 
Greek thing.

Psychologists rape people, basically.

1:52 He hath put down the mighty from their seats, and exalted them of
low degree.

1:53 He hath filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he hath
sent empty away.

1:54 He hath holpen his servant Israel, in remembrance of his mercy;
1:55 As he spake to our fathers, to Abraham, and to his seed for ever.

1:56 And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned to her
own house.

1:57 Now Elisabeth's full time came that she should be delivered; and
she brought forth a son.

1:58 And her neighbours and her cousins heard how the Lord had shewed
great mercy upon her; and they rejoiced with her.

"holpen" sounds like Swartzenegger.

What if they made a movie about the World from God's perspective?  I think it 
would be a comedy.

Once upon a time, a giant noticed his goose was gone.  "Well, shit!  I wonder

He pull-up his chair by his fire and got his smokes.

things.

2:22 Be not afraid, ye beasts of the field: for the pastures of the
wilderness do spring, for the tree beareth her fruit, the fig tree and
the vine do yield their strength.

2:23 Be glad then, ye children of Zion, and rejoice in the LORD your
God: for he hath given you the former rain moderately, and he will
cause to come down for you the rain, the former rain, and the latter
rain in the first month.

2:24 And the floors shall be full of wheat, and the vats shall
