1:16 And the children of the Kenite, Moses' father in law, went up out

wilderness of Judah, which lieth in the south of Arad; and they went
and dwelt among the people.

1:17 And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they slew the
Canaanites that inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. And the
name of the city was called Hormah.

1:18 Also Judah took Gaza with the coast thereof, and Askelon with the
coast thereof, and Ekron with the coast thereof.

1:19 And the LORD was with Judah; and he drave out the inhabitants of
the mountain; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley,
because they had chariots of iron.

Babylon, come; and I will look well unto thee: but if it seem ill unto

before thee: whither it seemeth good and convenient for thee to go,
thither go.

40:5 Now while he was not yet gone back, he said, Go back also to
Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, whom the king of
Babylon hath made governor over the cities of Judah, and dwell with
him among the people: or go wheresoever it seemeth convenient unto
thee to go. So the captain of the guard gave him victuals and a
reward, and let him go.

40:6 Then went Jeremiah unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and
dwelt with him among the people that were left in the land.

Peter Gadwa put MasterMind onto the Ticketmaster system.

MasterMind is a logic game where you try to make the minumum number of 
guesses.

I assume Pete thought MasterMind was debugging.

Debugging is not MasterMind scored by number of guesses, but scored on a time 
clock.

In programming, when you guess thoughtlessly, however, it is likely you are 
stupid and making bugs.

Thinking hard is painful like lifting weights.  Often, you can get by, 
avoiding thinking hard.  My operating system is navigated by keyboard, but 
when you are using cursor keys, it is painless compared to the pain of typing 
words.

If you can minimize the turn-around time for testing code, it is
strategically 
important.

It's true that you can guess a math sign in one guess, or guess true/false in 
one guess.  It's more painless to guess than think.  Yeah, this might be how 
bugs are born, frequently -- getting sloppy and lazy.

Judge me by my work and the quality of my code.  I wrote 130,000 lines over 
ten years.  I often employ strategy in place of tactics.  I am creative.  My 
solutions are elegant and tiny.  My operating system is very responsive.  I 
have divine intellect.

Someone suggested putting "interrupt" and "argpop" and "noargpop", function 
attributes into a more generic structure.  Planning for future growth is 
instinctive for programmers, but I am now in a completion mindset -- rarely
do 
programmers experience this.

It's limited to 100,000 lines forever!  I have been shortening labels.  
"GetDateTime()" is "Now()".  At this point, I am moving in the other
direction 
from planning for growth to the direction of nipping short.

Do you know how early BASIC programs had short labels like "Now()" for time?  
They are delightful.

Tasks have parent and child tasks, making a tree.  When I began my operating 
system, I called the first task, "root".  I had a /Root directory.  Then, it 
dawned on me that Root was not such a good name!  I changed it to "Adam". 
The 
moral is, there are many times when a new name is best.  If you use an old 
name for something, similar but not the same, you might be doing a disservice.

When doing math proof, sometimes you create a new entity like a stair in the 
way to heaven, just floating there.  This is thinking outside the box.  When 
making names, sometimes, it is best to pick a new name.
