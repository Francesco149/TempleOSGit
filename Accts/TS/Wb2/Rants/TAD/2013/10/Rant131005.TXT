which should not be done, and are guilty; 4:14 When the sin, which
they have sinned against it, is known, then the congregation shall
offer a young bullock for the sin, and bring him before the tabernacle
of the congregation.

4:15 And the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands upon the
head of the bullock before the LORD: and the bullock shall be killed
before the LORD.

4:16 And the priest that is anointed shall bring of the bullock's
blood to the tabernacle of the congregation: 4:17 And the priest shall
dip his finger in some of the blood, and sprinkle it seven times

Consistency is next to godliness.  Linux is about pipes and low resource
code. 
 TempleOS is about single-user high resource home computer that can lavish 
money to achieve simpler user code.  The TempleOS way is to request all files 
for a pattern, while other OSes get first and request next.


This takes one more line of code, and might confuse new people:

while (tempde) {
   tempde1=tempde->next
   ...
   DirEntryDel(tempde);
   tempde=tempde1;
}

while (tempde) {
  ...
  tempde=tempde->next;
}
DirEntryListDel(tempde1);

I debated with myself on TreeTraversing code, being inconsistent.  Half a 
dozen one way and six the other.

I made a crazy traveling salesman variation -- King Wenceslas.  I would just 
solve it by praying for good weather.  He's a saint.  God listens.  (God

17:18 Then certain philosophers of the Epicureans, and of the Stoicks,
encountered him. And some said, What will this babbler say? other
some, He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods: because he
preached unto them Jesus, and the resurrection.

I learned about P norms, taxi-driver norm.  Wenceslas has that.

The Carrier game is surprising -- the random enemy patterns do a good job of

How about fruits?

Did they like nuts?

Elephants just eat grass and wood.  They don't seem to care.  It makes me

He acts immature.  If he didn't act immature, would it be better? 

I'm not sure how I'd like to be seen like him.  "Ham"  I do that.

I saw this game trailer demo.  Some guys talked very seriously about a
