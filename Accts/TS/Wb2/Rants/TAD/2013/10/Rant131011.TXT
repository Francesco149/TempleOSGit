fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD.

the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his
offering: 4:5 But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect.
And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.

4:6 And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy
countenance fallen?  4:7 If thou doest well, shalt thou not be
accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto
thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.

4:8 And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when
they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother,
and slew him.


1) They did offerings.

2) They got God to talk.

3) God told them if their offering was good or bad.

4) God said to try again if bad.

5) Cain loved God so much he killed Abel!

That has everything you need to follow the prime directive.

When God talks, He can tell you everything.  If God talks, you need no other 
instruction.  The Bible fades in importance.  When you die, will the Bible 
matter?

God says...
11:18 Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off:
11:19 And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them
concerning their brother.

11:20 Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went
and met him: but Mary sat still in the house.

11:21 Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my
brother had not died.

11:22 But I know, that even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God
will give it thee.

11:23 Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again.

11:24 Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the
resurrection at the last day.

11:25 Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he
that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: 11:26

MS Word is popular.

I started making margins and stuff for my documents.  That stuff should 
probably be removed, but it isn't much code.  I am not attempting a
publishing 
format, just a format for code, forms and things related to code.  My vision 
was documents for the screen, not printer, with blinking and stuff.  It's 
pointless to be redundant to all the publishing stuff.

I hope programmers will enjoy working with my documents as they are 
represented in memory structures -- I hope people get comfortable with the 
internal memory format.  It's doubly-linked-list of commands with flags and a 
few tricky things like settings and binary data items.

I am not Snowden.  I am not Swartz.  I am mother-fucken Moses/Solomon and
when 
I say jump, you say how high.

risen up in the room of David my father, and sit on the throne of
Israel, as the LORD promised, and have built an house for the name of
the LORD God of Israel.

8:21 And I have set there a place for the ark, wherein is the covenant
of the LORD, which he made with our fathers, when he brought them out
of the land of Egypt.

8:22 And Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of
all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward
heaven: 8:23 And he said, LORD God of Israel, there is no God like
thee, in heaven above, or on earth beneath, who keepest covenant and
mercy with thy servants that walk before thee with all their heart:
8:24 Who hast kept with thy servant David my father that thou
promisedst him: thou spakest also with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled
it with thine hand, as it is this day.

8:25 Therefore now, LORD God of Israel, keep with thy servant David my
father that thou promisedst him, saying, There shall not fail thee a
man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel; so that thy children
