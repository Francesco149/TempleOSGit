commitment and bought homes instead of renting, how this was the American

follow liberal lies.

Home ownership is bad for people relocating to find work.

Life is a journey, not a destination.  A pro athlete or musician is filled 
with expectant joy.  They get the same joy as people playing the lottery -- 
hope for a wonderful future.

sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.

4:3 And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the
fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD.

4:4 And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of
the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his
offering: 4:5 But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect.
And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.

4:6 And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy
countenance fallen?  4:7 If thou doest well, shalt thou not be
accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto
thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.

they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother,
and slew him.

have to make a gradient for all the cylinders in this drawing:



By giving you just 4-bits of color, you have a good excuse for making a

are doing recreational programming, you don't want to spend so much time
