Twain had a line in King Arthur's Court, "The delusion was perfect, but it 
just didn't delude."

WWW.OSDEV.ORG is talking about a cross compiler.  In my jail, all media talks 
to me.  That one didn't make much sense.

Perhaps, they have made a [C:/Doc/HolyC.TXT.Z,1] HolyC compiler?  Impossible
-- my calling convention 
does not use regs to pass args into functions.

You really should write JIT code, not BIN files.

So, at boot, my Adam task compiles headers and 50,000 lines of additional 
code.  This fills the Adam symbol table.  When you compile other stuff JIT,
it 
uses the Adam task's symbol table, so you never need to deal with header 
files.

If you attempted to make an old-school BIN file, you can include 
[C:/Kernel/AOT.HPP.Z,1] which will import Adam's symbols and allow you to
compile.

What you might be asking is if I could write a symboltable-to-header routine.
 
It would dump the symbol table and make HolyC headers.  It wouldn't be that 
hard.  You would make two passes.  First pass, you would create class and 
#define entries.  The second pass you would create function headers.  Class 
dependencies would be a problem.  I guess you make three passes, first you 
create extern class{} entries.  That's lazy.

Each task has a symbol table, like a place where you store environment 
variables, but it stores all types of HolyC symbols -- functions, classes and 
#defines.

When compiling, if a symbol is not found in a task's symbol table, it checks 
the parent's.  All tasks are children of Adam.

All tasks have the same memory map, so nothing bad or unusual happens when
you 
go to your parent's symbol table.  Basically virtual addresses are identical 
to physical addresses and no protection stops you because it is ring-0-only.

Make an offering to God -- praise, hymn, poem, comic, or delightful 
conversation.  Then, get a response and make it fit the context you 
established just before.  You don't have to use just the Bible.  You 
frequently find meaning in proper nouns.  Sometimes, brutally manging the 
original in a funny way is the obvious answer.

disgusted by Jews obviously obsessed with Israel -- not American, not 
charitible.  All of them walk around and view the world like cornered animals.

It's kinda like this: "To those who have, more will be given; to those who 
have not, what little they have will be taken away."  It's one of those 
ironies that cowardly Jews who do sneaky shit and obsess on security cause 
their own downfall.

code from scratch and they only compile when you boot my operating system and 
run my compiler.  No way can you cross compile.  In 2004, I wrote a TASM

than one machine.  You'll write your code and soon discover it doen't work on 
another machine.  You'll fix it.  You'll try it on another machine and it 
won't work.  You fix it, maybe it works on a new machine.  You try another
new 
machine, doesn't work.  You fix it, you try another machine, doesn't work. 
At 
this point, you have next to zero confidence and no crystal ball telling you 
what luck your customers are having.

The Commodore 64 is our vision.  Go examine how it was used.  People typed-in 
and learned binary sprite data.  Think about the particular thrill offered by 
typing binary sprite data into it.

It was possible to survey the entire C64.

We offer a F1 help feature that lists all API functions.  You can see the 
light at the end of the tunnel of API functions.  I have capped the line
count 
at 100,000.  The vision is the C64 -- small, but this is modern 64-bit.

I'll bet a lot of people set-out to make modern video games, the carefully 
draw a 24-bit colored sprite or two, but get tired of making 16 frame 
animations of 24-bit sprites... they think they can do 3D, but all the
kiddies 
settle on 2D.

In other words, they start ambitions like they're going to paint a 10 foot 
mural on the wall.  They paint a few inches and give-up.  That's what the 
scene is, right now, am I right?  Video games are similar to kernel
developers 
at OSDEv.  The majority draw a small fraction of an ambitious project and 
give-up.

It had a BASIC shell.  You could type


PRINT "HELLO WORLD"

You could move thew cursor up off the bottom.

It had two character sets.  Neither was ASCII.

Fighting the Last War

I straddle old and new.  I will tell old people things they need to know.

1) When you do assembly language on a modern machine.  It is completely 
clusterfucked when you try to estimate timings.  If you write a simple loop
to 
time an instruction and subtract the loop overhead, you will get a negative 
time for that instruction.  You will soon learn execution time is related to 
cache hits and misses more then old-school hand crafted asm instructions. 
The 
rule of thumb -- count memory fetches in the instruction, will not help you.  
I have seen memory indexed loops just as fast as reg -- voodoo cleverness by 
the CPU.  CISC instructions get converted to RISC and optimized and scheduled 
by the CPU.  This is very weird when doing a compiler -- discouraging.

2) You are horribly Jedi-mind tricked.  I'll bet it never would occur to you 
that UTF32 should be used in place of ASCII through-out the entire tool chain.

3) You have linux on the brain, a main frame operating system.  This should
be 
shocking -- there is no reason for virtual (disk swapped) memory.

4) Hardware has DMA buffers.  You could live without interrupts.  Just poll 
every milisecond.

5) Everybody assumes drivers are good.  What good is a three button mouse? 
It 
is like a bad leg you cannot put your weight on.  What good is surround sound 
support?

6) Every other engineer operates between over engineering and under 
engineering.  A software engineer has absolutely no concept of 
overengineering.  He goes to his boss who asked for an airplane wing and
says, 
"I made it ten times stronger than you asked in case we have to change the 
engine."  His boss is pleased.  Everybody praises His skill.  More
complicated 
is better because noone want to look dumb.  Fucken look at the disgusting
shit 
known as USB!  They have branched networks off each port and they do not
allow 
generic terminal communication which could handle any issue much better.  You 
cannot use Hyperterm with a USB device.

6) Coming down the road, we might see nonvolitile memory as the only memory.  
You might want byte addressing for what used to be hard drive.  Today, we
load 
a disk block data and transform it into a memory structure.  We have
serialize 
and deserialize.  What if just Mallocs for disk and puts it all over the
place 
in unserialized structures?  That could certainly be a revolution.

Ohhh!!  Sorry.  Someone at OSDev is having an upgrade issue.  Yeah, I make 
changes that fuck-it-up.  Usually boot the new ISO and copy files and 
recompile with the new.  Your account files, you can change yourself.  You'll 
have to merge custom stuff, but you knew that.

VMWare has a "boot to BIOS".  Set to CDROM boot and boot the new ISO with the 
new compiler.  That should compile the new code.

When making changes, I sometimes have to temporarily regress my KCfg. file to 
compile, reboot, then put it back.

It gets really tricky working on the compiler.  I'd have to explain.

the ground.

89:45 The days of his youth hast thou shortened: thou hast covered him
with shame. Selah.

89:46 How long, LORD? wilt thou hide thyself for ever? shall thy wrath
burn like fire?

89:47 Remember how short my time is: wherefore hast thou made all men
in vain?

89:48 What man is he that liveth, and shall not see death? shall he
deliver his soul from the hand of the grave? Selah.

89:49 Lord, where are thy former lovingkindnesses, which thou swarest
unto David in thy truth?

A neuro scientist who thinks the brain can control pressing a key for a 1Mhz 
clock is a retard-nigger.  Any electrical engineer would call you a total 
nigger and laugh you to scorn.  Clock synchronization by not-very-accurate 
cells plus nerve-down arm 1mS delay with jitter.  Not to mention planning-out 
the sequence.

Quantumn random number site is gordon knot -- removes all doubt, sept 
retard-niggers with tinfoil hats.

Woman got experimented on my neuro scientists?  Or, suffered justice.  Or
just 
hypocondriact.

7:7 What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not
known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law
had said, Thou shalt not covet.

7:8 But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all
manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin was dead.

7:9 For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment
came, sin revived, and I died.

7:10 And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be
unto death.

7:11 For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by
it slew me.

7:12 Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just,
and good.

They're prolly too stupid to interpret.  LOL

I'm tired.  Wasting it on swine.

I took 5 asm courses, a compiler course and an operating system course and 
graphics and digital design and numeric methods.  Meat and potatoes.

I was a professional OS developer for Ticketmaster at age 20 1990-1996 in VAX 
asm.  I was paid for x86 asm, 8051 asm, 68000 asm, PIC asm, Atmel AVR asm,
all 
on bare metal with no operating system.

I am an expert on the region between hardware and software, reading 
datasheets.

That's what I'm an expert in, and only that.  They don't come any more
expert. 
 I'm the best programmer on the planet, that's why God chose me for His 
temple.  It is divine intellect, like the Bible.  God made several decisions. 
640x480 16 color, single voice, no child windows, controlled the evolution, 
laughed when I made neato funny bugs, before I saw them.  Guided the magical 
evolution into a magical wonderland of elegant original solutions to
operating 
system problems.

24:4 And Moses wrote all the words of the LORD, and rose up early in
the morning, and builded an altar under the hill, and twelve pillars,
according to the twelve tribes of Israel.

24:5 And he sent young men of the children of Israel, which offered
burnt offerings, and sacrificed peace offerings of oxen unto the LORD.

24:6 And Moses took half of the blood, and put it in basons; and half
of the blood he sprinkled on the altar.

24:7 And he took the book of the covenant, and read in the audience of
the people: and they said, All that the LORD hath said will we do, and
be obedient.

24:8 And Moses took the blood, and sprinkled it on the people, and
said, Behold the blood of the covenant, which the LORD hath made with
you concerning all these words.

24:9 Then went up Moses, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of
the elders of Israel: 24:10 And they saw the God of Israel: and there

1:18 While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy
sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest
brother's house: 1:19 And, behold, there came a great wind from the
wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon
the young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell
thee.

1:20 Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and
fell down upon the ground, and worshipped, 1:21 And said, Naked came I
out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: the LORD
gave, and the LORD hath taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD.

1:22 In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.

2:1 Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present
themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them to present
himself before the LORD.

I purposely blurred the line between public and private functions and global 
variables.  When I was a kid, I had that book, Mapping the Commodore 64.  I 
want to break normal rules so kids can have fun.  When I was in high school I 
did lots of projects for fun with no thought of distributing them -- I was
not 
being professional.  I want kids to do modifications that never end-up in the 
master code... just playing around, for fun.  A professional does not make
any 
modification which must be repeatedly merged if code is updated.

Perhaps, I am done in a more firm way.  At this point I imagine endless 
refinements and improvements, but maybe that's bad and a 
set-in-stone-for-all-time version would be best, like the Commodore64 ROM.

I looked at Linux code in 2004 and saw #ifdef's for different architectures.  
I thought it made the code miserable and I decided to do the opposite.  I 
support one architecture with minimal abstraction, even if this platform dies.

You are on your own doing ARM.  I might be secretely pleased, but that is not 
my vision.  Somebody put my code on GitHub.  It's public domain.  What is it 
doing on GitHub for LOL?  It cannot be compiled.
