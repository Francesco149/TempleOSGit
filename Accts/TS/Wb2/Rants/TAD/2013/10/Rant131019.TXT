Every 6 months, I give a lump sum, my 10% tithe, to some charity.  I have 
given to feed-the-world type charities,  KNPR, services for the blind, and 
Audobon.  Last July I tried to give to KNPR.  I went to their web page; they 
remembered me and I did a one-time-donation.  It's usually hard to do 
one-time-donations because they always pressure into memberships.  I hate 
that.  So, they remembered me and I thought it was odd they didn't ask credit 
card number, but maybe they remembered.

I check my balance, no transaction.  I wait a couple days, checking... 
nothing.  I get a call because it's kinda large amount, $800.  They ask, "Are 
you sure?"  Yep.  I Wait a couple days.  Nothing.  I say fuck-it and give the 
money to Audobon.  You have to understand, by this time, this is a very 
unpleasant customer experience.

I get a statement from KNPR in the mail saying $800.  Oh shit!  They've 
overdrafted me!  I sweat for a few days, but no charge shows-up on my
account. 
 I figure-out they want me to write a check.  Fuck-them.

This station has gotten sleazy.  I kinda don't like them.  I just got another 
"pay us $800" bill today.  Fuck-em.  I'll think about it in December, but 
fucking demons make this shit an ordeal when it should be thoughtless ease. 
I 
like paying on-line, not this snail-mail check shit.  Why do you think I 
pledged on-line?  Son of a bitch.

I have a little brother who takes tipping in a restaurant very seriously.  (I 
don't like that he essentially makes the waitresses grovel, in a way.) Making 
KNPR grovel is not what I like to see in the mirror.  Fuck them -- 
unintentionally, this turned into a demon Hell experience.  Fuck them.
