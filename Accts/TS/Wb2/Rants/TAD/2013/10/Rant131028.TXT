might wherewith he fought against Amaziah king of Judah, are they not
written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?  13:13
And Joash slept with his fathers; and Jeroboam sat upon his throne:
and Joash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel.

13:14 Now Elisha was fallen sick of his sickness whereof he died. And
Joash the king of Israel came down unto him, and wept over his face,
and said, O my father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the
horsemen thereof.

13:15 And Elisha said unto him, Take bow and arrows. And he took unto
him bow and arrows.

You know what?  God did not like my Niagra art.  He uses honest measures.  He 
does not like my drumming, either.  I don't think God likes sports.  I saw 
thins insane chase.  A male monkey had a hareem and a group of other males 
monkeys attacked.   He ran and climbed a tree.  It made human sports look 
silly.  I wonder if God evaluates all the lion chases on equal terms with 
human sports activities.  No wonder He doesn't like sports.

I tease God.  We don't have animals the eat prey alive.  God is nice to every 
creature.  I tease Him that God got His cheap thrills during dinosaur fights.

2:5 The LORD was as an enemy: he hath swallowed up Israel, he hath
swallowed up all her palaces: he hath destroyed his strong holds, and
hath increased in the daughter of Judah mourning and lamentation.

2:6 And he hath violently taken away his tabernacle, as if it were of
a garden: he hath destroyed his places of the assembly: the LORD hath
caused the solemn feasts and sabbaths to be forgotten in Zion, and
hath despised in the indignation of his anger the king and the priest.

2:7 The LORD hath cast off his altar, he hath abhorred his sanctuary,
he hath given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces;

My original design was for desktops.  If you do not put multicores into a HLT 
state, you can dispatch faster because it does not take a WAKE interrupt. 
The 
only way to wake a halted CPU is an interrupt.  That is slower than signaling 
"go" with a memory flag.

I grudgingly got less aggressive in seeking performance and, now, it puts
them 
in a HLT state.  There are times when my CPU is not HLTed but is idle.  I 
don't remember which.

and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl
of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over
every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.

1:27 So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created
he him; male and female created he them.

1:28 And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and
multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion
over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every
living thing that moveth upon the earth.

1:29 And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed,
which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which
is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.

1:30 And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air,
and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is
life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.

 Then, I can remove FAT32 and ISO9660.  (I might want to change clusters to

thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon came I unto the king, and
after certain days obtained I leave of the king: 13:7 And I came to
Jerusalem, and understood of the evil that Eliashib did for Tobiah, in
preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of God.

stuff to Tobiah out of the chamber.

brought I again the vessels of the house of God, with the meat
