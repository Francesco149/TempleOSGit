I can and have proven God exists.

Technically, I have just proven a powerful lifeform.  I'm not stupid -- I'm 
calling Him God.  I have evidence He has acted with foreplanning since Bible 
days.  It could generations.

You've proven God does not exist; now, prove He does.

I was thinking about the milk digestion gene in humans.  One individual had a 
mutation and all of us are his discendents, more or less?  So, it's like 
everybody else got killed-off, if you think about it.

How many milk digestion genes are there in human evolution?  For any progress 
in evolution, that's just crazy!

I believe in evolution.  I have proven God exists and can control things.  It 
points to Him being active during evolution.  That points to more rapid 
progress than just random.  We really have no quantative probability 
understanding of evolution.  It could be anything -- orders of magnitude 
higher probability than just non-intelligent-design, whatever that means.

3:2 A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife,
vigilant, sober, of good behaviour, given to hospitality, apt to
teach; 3:3 Not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre;
but patient, not a brawler, not covetous; 3:4 One that ruleth well his
own house, having his children in subjection with all gravity; 3:5
(For if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take
care of the church of God?)  3:6 Not a novice, lest being lifted up
with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil.

3:7 Moreover he must have a good report of them which are without;
lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.

3:8 Likewise must the deacons be grave, not doubletongued, not given
to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre; 3:9 Holding the mystery of
the faith in a pure conscience.

OSDev is asking about interrupt routines.  I wrote my own 64-bit compiler and 
assembler.  They do exactly what I want.  I made a "interrupt" keyword for 
interrupt functions.  It uses IRET and saves C_REGS not normally saved by my 
compiler.

My assembler makes GCC look really ugly.

I wrote a 64-bit assembler and compiler.  I am an assembly-language God.

[C:/Demo/Lectures/64BitAsmQuiz.TXT.Z,1]

Everybody knows 16-bit asm because we all lived in 1990.  Only I know 64-bit 
asm because I wrote an assembler and compiler.

Mine has been 64-bit since late 2007.  I planned ahead from 2004 for 64-bit 
making emulated EAX:EDX EBX:ECX operations.

In 2004, with-in a month or two of starting, I had written a C interpretor
for 
the command-line.  I made it a full optimized compiler over the years.  I
have 
worked 10 years, full-time, and written 130,000 lines of code.

I have no code from other sources.  All was written from scratch -- no cruft.
 
God's temple must be perfect without blemish.

God said 640x480 16 color.  He likes that.  It is more or less the same logic 
as giving children 8-color crayon boxes.

It has many advantages.  My built-in LZW compression works on 16 color, for 
example.

I did an electronic device for regulating wall socket voltage (line

Boss said to do solid state.  God said reverse engineering is okay for young 
engineers.  Omron makes relays.

So, I had to change taps to pick the right voltage and TRIAC are a bitch 
because they false trigger and two taps short-circuit.  It burned traces.  
Solid State relays cost $20 and I needed 6, but TRIAC were like $5 for each 
circuit.  The competitor product was like $150 total and used 3 relays.

I got this things that's fucken short-circuiting, is way higher priced than 
the competator... I'm feeling miserable.  It is solid-state -- better
product. 
 But I ended-up putting little resisters in each of the 6 tap circuits to act 
as fuses.  They burn if short-circuit and act as current limiters.  Fucken
