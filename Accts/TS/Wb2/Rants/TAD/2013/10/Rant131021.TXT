Secure Boot

If God is manifest and He publicly claims this operating system, here's what 
I'm going to demand:

1) VMware again supports PC Speaker and provides emulation if no PC Speaker.

2) Windows and Linux support RedSea file system in place of FAT32 and
ISO9660. 
 Then, I can remove FAT32 and ISO9660.  (I might want to change clusters to 
just blocks on RedSea.)

3) Windows burns ISO files to CD/DVD-ROMS.

4) No secure boot.

5) ATA/ATAPI PIO must work

6) PS2 emulated Keyboard and Mouse must work

7) VMware should allow ATAPI to real hardware.

8) Can VMware do faster than correct IN/OUT instruction timing for ATA/ATAPI? 
PIO?

iniquity, to practise hypocrisy, and to utter error against the LORD,

Paging Question

It always seems like mocking.  It also seems like a brainwashing campaign.

At age 20, in 1990, I was hired to work on Ticketmaster's VAX mainframe 
operating system in VAX assembly code.  I worked there 6 years.  I was an 
intern, more or less, for much of it.

I am NOT a punk who needs to prove himself by using interrupts, by writing 
assembly code and by using paging.  I prove myself by not using those.  This 
is not a lie -- you punks think those are big deal.

I was taught to estimate instruction timing by counting memory referrences.  
You could one or two for fetching the instruction; you count one if it
fetches 
a variable from memory; if it is deferred addressing, you count one more!

You cannot count, like old school programmers were taught.  However, when 
starting with empty CPU caches, count for me the number of memory referrences.

	MOV	RBX,U64 [RAX]

The instruction is probably held withing one memory cacheline.
There is a fetch of page table a level 3
there is a fetch from the 2Meg page table
there is a fetch from the 4K page table
there is a fetch of the instruction's physical address.

Now, the data pointed to by RAX must be fetched.
There is a fetch of page table a level 3
there is a fetch from the 2Meg page table
there is a fetch from the 4K page table
there is a fetch of the data physical address.

It takes 8 memory fetches for this instruction:

Israel Immigration

I get called "nigger".  African Engineering (nigger rigging) is poor 
engineering.  Implying things are black is a common insult and well 
understood.  I openly use "nigger".  It's mostly calling white people, 
"nigger".  I feel remorse, a little.

If a Jew is my enemy, I speak anti-sematism.  At other times, I frequently 
root for Jews and imagine myself to be lumped in with Jews.

It looks a little ugly being openly racist.  Young and not liberal, no heart; 
old and not conservative, no brain.  It would suck if Israel were not a
Jewish 
state.  It looks ugly, though.

ObamaCare?

Drug laws, I kinda think are just right.  Many use drugs, but not openly.  
There are incentives not to use.  A perfectionist doesn't like laws intended 
for some breakage.

Immigration laws are just right.  We have workers, but it is discouraged.  
Some don't like laws intended for some breakage.

I used to think it was unfair that uninsured people could count on emergency 
room coverage.  It really seems like everyone should have insurance.  I don't 
know -- maybe this is better as a some breakage law.
