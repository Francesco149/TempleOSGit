I used to suffer from nightmares.  Yeah, sometimes the news (which 
intentionally hypes headlines to make them scary) would give me nightmares.  
Often, I would dwell on dark topic, like the Holocaust and evolution.

Peter Gadwa said that often an outsider can look at a person and say, "Your 
problem is obvious!"

Anyway, occassionally, you'll see a person who obesses on dark topics.  It's 
very profound that you can choose to dwell on happy stuff.  Stay "in the

Caiaphas being the high priests, the word of God came unto John the
son of Zacharias in the wilderness.

3:3 And he came into all the country about Jordan, preaching the
baptism of repentance for the remission of sins; 3:4 As it is written
in the book of the words of Esaias the prophet, saying, The voice of
one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his
paths straight.

3:5 Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be
brought low; and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough
ways shall be made smooth; 3:6 And all flesh shall see the salvation
of God.

3:7 Then said he to the multitude that came forth to be baptized of
him, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the
wrath to come?  3:8 Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance,

I'm not a widow.  I was thinking of Tweety and how lots of old ladies
probably 
like birds.  I made a clever word play.

God likes wit. Be charming.  Don't be earnest and dull.  Jacob tussled with 
God.  (God loved Jacob.)  Be yourself, though.

Earnest is usually tedious to listen to.  God never says anything obvious -- 
doesn't bother.  When you realize what a gift God's company is... 

If God is infinitely intelligent, you probably think, "I could never imagine 
it, it would be so glorious."

Guess what?  It has to sound like something.  If the answer is what everybody 
expects, it will sound pretty ordinary coming from God.  You'd say, "Huh.  I 
knew that.  Is that it?"  God doesn't do that.

* See [C:/Doc/ImportExports.TXT,1] Scoping and Linkages for details on
extern, import, _extern, _import, 
etc.

* See [C:/Doc/Directives.TXT,1].

* Built-in types include I0,I8,I16,I32,I64 for signed 0-8 byte ints and U0,U8,
U16,U32,I64 for unsigned 0-8 byte ints and F64 for 8 byte floats.

	U0	void
	I8	char
	U8	unsigned char
	I16	short
	U16	unsigned short
	I32	int
	U32	unsigned int
	I64	long (64-bit)
	I64	unsigned long (64-bit)
	F64	double
	no F32 float.

* Function with no args, or just default args can be called without 
parentheses. 

* Default args don't have to be on the end.  This code is valid:
  U0 Test(I64 i=4,I64 j,I64 k=5)
{
  Print("%X %X %X\n",i,j,k);
}

Test(,3);

* A char const all alone is sent to [MN:PutChars] PutChars().  A string with
or without args 
is sent to [MN:Print] Print().  An empty string literal signals a variable
fmt_str 
follows.

  void Demo(char drv,char *fmt,char *name,int age)
{
  printf("Hello World!\n");
  printf("%s age %d\n",name,age);
  printf(fmt,name,age);
  putchar(drv);
  putchar('*');
}

U0 Demo(U8 drv,U8 *fmt,U8 *name,I64 age)
{
  "Hello World!\n";
  "%s age %d\n",name,age;
  "" fmt,name,age;
  '' drv;
  '*';
}

* When dealing with function addresses, precede the name with "&".

* There is no main() function.  Any code outside of functions gets executed
on 
start-up, in order.

* You can access bytes or words within any int.  i.u8[2] returns bits 24-27
in 
the variable, i.  See [C:/TempleOS/Kernel/Adam1a.HPP.Z,50] I64 declaration. 
The real feature is that a class can 
be accessed as a whole, if you put a type in front of the class declaration.

* Variable arg count functions (...) can access their args with built-in 
variables similar to 'this' in C++.  They are 'I64 argc' and 'I64 argv[]'.  
  
  U0 GrPrint(CDC *dc,I64 x,I64 y,U8 *fmt,...)
  {
    U8 *buf=SPrintJoin(NULL,fmt,argc,argv);
    GrPrint(dc,x,y,buf);
    Free(buf);
  }
  
* Allows "5<i<j+1<20" instead of "5<i && i<j+1 && j+1<20".
  
if (13<=age<20)
  "Teen-ager";

* switch statements always use a jump table.  Don't use them with cases with 
really big, sparse ranges.

* Allows ranges like "case 4...7:" in switch statements. 

* nobound_switch can be used if you know a switch statement will not exceed 
the lowest or highest case values.  It's a little faster because it doesn't 
check.

* noreg or reg can be placed before a function local var name.  You can, 
optionally, specify a reg after the reg keyword.

* interrupt, haserrcode, public, argpop or noargpop are function flags. See 
[C:/Demo/Lectures/PageTableEntries2.CPP.Z,1].

* A nounusedwarn statement will suppress an unused var warning.

* You can have multiple member vars of a class named "pad" or "reserved", and 
it won't issue warnings. 

* Type casting is postfix.  To typecast int or F64, use
[C:/TempleOS/Kernel/Adam1b.HPP.Z,210] ToI64(),
[C:/TempleOS/Kernel/Adam1b.HPP.Z,212] ToBool() or 
[C:/TempleOS/Kernel/Adam1b.HPP.Z,211] ToF64(). (TempleOS follows normal C
float<-->int conversion, but sometimes you 
want to override.  These functions are better than multiplying by "1.0" to 
convert to float.) 

* A single quote can encompass multiple characters.  'ABC' is equal to 0x43424
1.

* The "`" operator raises a base to a power.

* There is no question-colon operator.

* You can use [C:/TempleOS/Compiler/Directives.CPP.Z,6]
OptOn([C:/TempleOS/Kernel/Adam1a.HPP.Z,1581] OPTf_WARN_PAREN) to find
unnecessary parentheses in code.

* You can use [C:/TempleOS/Compiler/Directives.CPP.Z,6]
OptOn([C:/TempleOS/Kernel/Adam1a.HPP.Z,1582] OPTf_WARN_DUP_TYPES) to find dup
local var type 
statements.

* With the #exe{} feature in your src code, you can place programs that
insert 
text into the stream of code being compiled.  See [C:/Kernel/KEnd.CPP,1] #exe
{} for an example where 
the date/time and compile-time prompting for cfguration data is placed into a 
program.  [MN:StreamPrint] StreamPrint() places text into a src program
stream following the 
conclusion of the #exe{} blk.

* No #define functions exist (I'm not a fan)

* No typedef, use class.

* No type-checking

* Can't use <> with #include, use "".

* "$" is an escape character.  Two dollar signs signify an ordinary $.  See 
[C:/Doc/Dollar.TXT,1].  In asm or [C:/Doc/HolyC.TXT,1] HolyC code, it also
refers to the instruction's 
addr. 

* union is more like a class, so you don't reference it with a union label 
after you define it.  Some common unions are declared in
[C:/TempleOS/Kernel/Adam1a.HPP.Z,12] Adam1a.HPP for 1,2,4 
and 8 byte objects.  If you place a type in front of a union declaration,
that 
is the type when used by itself.  See [C:/Demo/SubIntAccess.CPP,1]. 

* class member vars can have meta data. fmtstr and fmtdata are two meta data 
types now used.  All compiler structures are saved and you can access the 
compiler's info about classes and vars.  See [C:/Demo/ClassMeta.CPP,1] and  
[C:/TempleOS/Adam/Doc/DocPopUp.CPP.Z,291] DocFormDo().

* There is a keyword lastclass you use as a dft arg.  It is set to the class 
name of the previous arg.  See [C:/TempleOS/Adam/Dbg2a.CPP.Z,134] ClassRep().

* See [C:/Demo/Exceptions.CPP,1].  try{} catch{} and throw are different from
C++. 
throw is a function with var ("...") args.  The values passed in throw() can 
be accessed from within a catch{} using the Fs->except_argc and Fs->except_arg
v[] vars.  Within a catch {} blk, set the var Fs->catch_except to TRUE if you 
want to terminate the search for a handler.  By convention, the first arg of e
xcept_argv[] specifies the exception type num.  A list of assigned exception 
types can be found at .  For a handler that will catch all excepts, you can 
use [C:/TempleOS/Kernel/Except.CPP.Z,111] PutExcept().

* A function is available similar to sizeof which provides the offset of a 
member of a class.  It's called offset.  You place the class name and member 
inside as in offset(classname.membername).  It has nothing to do with 16-bit 
code.  Both sizeof and offset only accept one level of member vars.  That is, 
you can't do sizeof(classname.membername.submembername).

* There is no continue statement.  Use goto.

* No bit field support, but there are bit access [Bit,1] library routines.

* lock{} can be used to apply asm LOCK prefixes to code for safe multicore 
read-modify-write accesses.  The code bracked with have LOCK asm prefix's 
applied to relevant instructions within.  It's a little shoddy.  See 
[C:/Demo/MultiCore/Lock.CPP,1].

* There is a function called [C:/TempleOS/Kernel/Memory.CPP.Z,951] MSize()
which gives the size of an object 
allocated off the heap.  For larger size allocations, the system rounds-up to 
a power of two, so MSize() lets you know the real size and you can take full 
advantage of it.

* You can [C:/TempleOS/Kernel/Memory.CPP.Z,950] Free() a NULL ptr.  Useful
variants of [C:/TempleOS/Kernel/Memory.CPP.Z,956] MAlloc() can be found
[C:/TempleOS/Kernel/Memory.CPP.Z,963] Here.  
Each task has a heap and you can MAlloc and Free off of other task's heaps,
or 
make an independent heap with [MN:HeapCtrlBPInit] HeapCtrlBPInit().

* The stk does not grow because virtual mem is not used.  I recommend 
allocating large local vars from the heap.  You can change
[C:/TempleOS/Kernel/Adam1a.HPP.Z,2731] DFT_STK and 
recompile Kernel or request more when doing a
[C:/TempleOS/Kernel/Task1a.CPP.Z,224] Spawn().  You can use 
[C:/TempleOS/Kernel/Task1a.CPP.Z,89] CallStkGrow(), but it's odd.  See
[C:/Demo/StkGrow.CPP,1]. 

* Only one base class is allowed.

* All values are extended to 64-bit when accessed.  Intermediate calculations 
are done with 64-bit values.

  The follow examples should be inserted in a function, so that reg variables 
are used.  (Global vars are never reg.)

I16 i;
I32 j;
j=i=0x12345678; //Resulting i is 0x5678 but j is 0x12345678

I64 i=0x8000000000000000;
Print("%X\n",i>>1);  //Result is 0xC000000000000000 as expected

U64 u=0x8000000000000000;
Print("%X\n",u>>1);  //Result is 0x4000000000000000 as expected

I32 i= 0x80000000;   //const is loaded into a 64-bit reg var.
Print("%X\n",i>>1);  //Result is 0x40000000

I32 i=-0x80000000;
Print("%X\n",i>>1);  //Result is 0xC0000000 as expected


                                 Print Family

[MN:MPrint] MPrint() is like [MN:SPrint] SPrint() but it returns a
[C:/TempleOS/Kernel/Memory.CPP.Z,956] MAllocated str.  It is vary handy 
because you don't have to worry about overflow.

[C:/TempleOS/Kernel/TaskCmd.CPP.Z,354] Auto(U8 *fmt,...) sends text to the
current task's input buffer.
[C:/TempleOS/Kernel/TaskCmd.CPP.Z,384] AutoStr(U8 *fmt,...) sends text of an
[C:/Doc/Glossary.TXT,1] AutoFile to the keyboard stream of the 
current TASK but can also do mouse cmds.

[C:/TempleOS/Kernel/TaskCmd.CPP.Z,333] XTalk(CTask *task,U8 *fmt,...) and
text to another task's input buffer.
[C:/TempleOS/Kernel/TaskCmd.CPP.Z,409] XTalkStr(CTask *task,U8 *fmt,...)
sends text of an [C:/Doc/Glossary.TXT,1] AutoFile to the keyboard 
stream of another TASK but can also do mouse cmds.

[MN:DocPrint] DocPrint(CDoc *doc,U8 *fmt,...) sends text to a document.  You
can buffer to a 
Doc and save it, providing the functionality of fprintf.  See 
[C:/Demo/Dsk/FPrintF.CPP,1].

[C:/TempleOS/Kernel/TaskCmd.CPP.Z,286] Adam(U8 *fmt,...) sends text to the
adam task to be compiled and run.
[C:/TempleOS/Kernel/TaskCmd.CPP.Z,307] AdamLog(U8 *fmt,...) and
[C:/TempleOS/Kernel/TaskCmd.CPP.Z,319] AdamErr(U8 *fmt,...) send text to the
adam task to be 
displayed.

[MN:StreamPrint] StreamPrint(U8 *fmt,...) sends text to the stream of code
being compiled and 
must reside in a #exe{} blk.

[MN:GrPrint] GrPrint(CDC *dc,I64 x,I64 y,U8 *fmt,...) and [MN:GrVPrint]
GrVPrint() plots text in graphics 
mode.

[MN:ExePrint] ExePrint(U8 *fmt,...) compiles and execute a string.  Note: It
returns the 
result of the last executed expression.

[MN:AFPrint] AFPrint(I64 mS,U8 *fmt) [MN:PutChars] PutChars()s one at a time
with a delay.

[MN:RawPrint] RawPrint(I64 mS,U8 *fmt) sends direct to screen memory,
bypassing window 
manager.

**Note:** Use Print("%s",src) if you need an unmodified string.


The [MN:Print] Print() family supports extended format codes.  See
[MN:SPrintJoin] SPrintJoin().
  %[-][0][width][.decimals][flags][hsub_fmt][main_fmt]

flags:
    * 't' is a flag which will truncate to field width.
* ',' is a flag which will add commas every three digits in a %d, %f, %g, 
%e and %n entries.
* '$' is a flag which affects the %Q entry, converting '$' to "\044".
* 'k' is a flag which forces 1000 instead of 1024 on integer with sub_fmts
.
  
sub_fmt:
    For "%n", "%d" or "%u", the sub_fmt causes thousands mode.
  "%h?n" will pick a var exponent multiples of three unit, while "%h-3n", 
for example, will display milli units or "%h6n" will display mega units.  
The 'k' flag is always on for "%n".  See [C:/Demo/Print.CPP,1].
  
*  "%n" will print a floating point in engineering notation, exponents being 
multiples of three.  If it has a sub_fmt code, it will display scientific 
units letters.

* "%S" will print a Define entry.

* "%C" will print a ToUpper character.

* "%F" will print a text file.

* "%P" will display a PSECT expression which is good for ptrs or addresses.

* "%z" will display a subentry of an enumerated list of text entries.  It 
calls [MN:LstSub] LstSub().  Pass subentry first, list second.

* "%Z" will display a Define subentry.  Pass subentry first, lst_define 
second.

* "%Q" will convert "\" to "\\" and quote to backslash quote. (For use in 
creating strs in strs.)

* "%q" will reverse a "%Q".

Most self respecting mainstream Americans think the Mafia is scumbags.

The same people like the CIA.  They set aside their morals because these 
scumbags are on their side.

The CIA operates by extortion.  'You know what that means?  They find-out 
anything they can use against you, they try to make you do shit they can use 
against you.  Everybody's got shit.  I just confessed and laughed at them 
because God's here, fucken retards.

Let me tell you something, mainstream Americans.  The CIA does evil and it 
does not help our country -- God is just.

Did you know the Ancient Roman Empire, as great as it was, mostly fought
civil 
wars?  You think the CIA helps this country.  It doesn't.  God is perfectly 
just.  Evil gets you no where.  Doing nothing is very likely to cause your 
enemies to fall to pieces.  Good guys finish first or at least the same for 
less money.

Disband the CIA -- they curse this country.  Go commit suicide, you useless 
scumbags.  Fucken Mafia fucks.

LORD will surely deliver us: this city shall not be delivered into the

Make an agreement with me by a present, and come out to me: and eat ye

Jews talking about nuclear programs.... talk like that doesn't sound good.  
Fucken God's gonna talk back at you with very loud voice!  They're too
stupid. 
 Actually, Jews look God eye to eye and audatiously press their luck in
insane 
ways.  Jews live by laws, not morality.  Somehow, they think the law is 
supreme.  If they find a loophole they will do a victory dance and mock you, 
thinking they are safe behind the letter of the law.

A lot of people think they are clever because they act immoral but within the 
law.  From my standpoint, they look incredibly stupid.  Dude!!  You have no 
protection and you're dancing around where God can hit you.  Jews are the
kind 
of people who would fuck with a bully thinking the law would protect them.

Earlier, I defined a "nigger" as someone who does not know God's world is

is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.

God is error proof on picking passages if He feels like it.  (Guy on radio

surprise 
Him, though.  He is not so insecure that He won't shut up on a world stage if 
I'm not worthy.  I joke He would shoot hostages.  God takes no shit.

That last one was more or less a dud, but indicated crazy thinking!  
Sometimes, the big picture matters.  Just move-on -- these are not precious
-- 
we can make more.  In fact, nobody ever need return to these -- get fresh 
ones!

little while later.
