I did FAT32 filesystem, then got distraught because FAT was patented and the 
enemies were psy-oping me.  So, I made my own file system and removed FAT.  I 
made is simple, so could not be sued.  I added FAT back in, a couple years 
later.

It one point I had encryption -- just made-up nasty formula.  I decided it
was 
too stressful and also did not want the stress of provoking the enemy.  
Encryption really is against my way of thinking.

BASIC might be good, but I want no part of it.  I certainly would be opposed 
to a bastardized BASIC proving full functionality.  It's for beginners. 
There 
are two problems -- you would ruin its simplicity and you would cause people 
to cling when they should move-on to HolyC.  I would want interpreted BASIC 
instead of compiled, just so it sucked, and saved line count.  I like the 
100,000 line cap.  Actually with a JIT HolyC compiler a BASIC compiler would 
be just about as easy as interpreted.

spoken the parable against them: and they left him, and went their
way.

12:13 And they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the
Herodians, to catch him in his words.

12:14 And when they were come, they say unto him, Master, we know that
thou art true, and carest for no man: for thou regardest not the
person of men, but teachest the way of God in truth: Is it lawful to
give tribute to Caesar, or not?  12:15 Shall we give, or shall we not
give? But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said unto them, Why tempt ye
me? bring me a penny, that I may see it.

12:16 And they brought it. And he saith unto them, Whose is this image
and superscription? And they said unto him, Caesar's.

I told you I want to make Windows and Linux support my Red Sea filesystem in 
place of FAT32 AND ISO9660, so I can remove that nasty redundnacy and save 
line count and make God's perfect.

I have a cluster allocation bitmap.  I kinda kept clusters from FAT32.  You 
know what?  It should probably be optimized for tiny sized drives.  That's 
what all my current stuff is.  I could just use blocks, not clusters. 
Someone 
had an idea of teared bitmaps.  Well, I'm wondering if I should have big
balls 
and pick blocks and not teared.

I'm in no hurry.  I'll just change it down the road and not think twice about 
havoc, LOL.

The fucken calculations -- you have to know 8000 words and plot a trajectory 
of roughby evenly timed intervals to pick-off 20 words about half a second 
apart.  You cannot get any word you want, you must choose from about 10 
possible words.  You have to know how the Mhz clock syncs with the 1kHz clock 
-- it doesn't.  You have...

Let's just say this is equal to "You only use 10% of your brain."  Except you 
declared war on God and He's gonna fuck you bad.


So the stream of 8000 words is modulo postitioned on a 1Mhz clock and that 
1Mhz clock signal is passing under a 1Khz clock, not a fixed modulo interval 
and I press the button about every 500milliseconds +/- 10mS  and I have to 
predict what interrupt cycle and message passing is in play on for the time
of 
the sampling of the 1Mhz clock.  Yeah -- it's 1Mhz critical not 1kHz critical 
because the task delays in windowes messaging vary in micreoseoncds.

Every single electrical engineer on the planet will call you the stoopidest

Someone at OSDev might be having upgrade difficulties.  I feel evil.  Boot
the

MakeOSInstallBootLoader('C').

I can't understand what delusion OSDev is trying to say.  I thought it was 
obvious HolyC could only be compiled by my own compiler, since I invented the 
language.  My language has different operator precidence rules and has
postfix 
typecasting.  

Perhaps, they made a HolyC modification to gcc.  #exe{} is a feature where 
code executes at compile time. That presents a nightmare.  The purpose of the 
code is to ask config questions and insert a few spots of custom code into
the 
stream.

Upgrading is often quite tricky, espcially, if you are doing a merge, I 
imagine. Boot the new ISO and use the new ISO compiler to compile the new
code 
once you install the new code on the hard disk.

I wrote all the code from scratch, including the compiler and bootloaders.

You know?  Elephants really have signs of fat-folds and stuff.  If elephants 
were humans, they'd be pretty awful.  They have dignity and exude cheerful 
goodness.  No evil vibes from an elephant.  Elephants are kinda like fat 
chicks.  Everybody's got good and bad moods but fat chicks usually are nice.  
They can be demon spawn shrews, but psychologists did a study and fat people 
are jolly.

If you are working on the kernel or compiler modules, you static compile the

This is my old grub file. My boot-loaders will not boot Linux.  Linux needs 
grub.  I don't think Linux does normal chain loading like Windows or TempleOS.
 

menuentry "TempleOS D" {
	insmod chain
	set root=(hd0,msdos1)
	chainloader +1
}

menuentry "TempleOS E" {
	insmod chain
	set root=(hd0,msdos5)
	chainloader +1
}

menuentry "TempleOS I" {
	insmod chain
	set root=(hd1,msdos5)
	chainloader +1
}

Those are probably out of date.  Grub is evil.  I edited the direct file -- 
you're supposed to fuck around with a file that generates it.

Just use my boot-loader.  [C:/Doc/Boot.TXT.Z,1]
The trick to my boot-loader is you must run an Install to patch it.
