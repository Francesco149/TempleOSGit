At the moment, my back's not hurting, my feet don't hurt, no problem with my 
teeth and my stomach's okay.  I don't have any trouble with the law, my 
finances are not a problem and no relative has a problem, not that I would 
know.

Thank You, God!

Both my birds are alive and my parents are alive.  I have not seen death.

Nothing is good, but nothing is bad.

I don't have a car, I don't have a job, I don't have wife or kids.

I don't have bills, I don't have chores or anything I have to do.

I ate a really good frozen microwaved pot pie.  Normally, when eating, you
get 
a bit of gristle or bone or a hair -- usually, there's something that's a 
downer.  Today, I decided to notice when there's nothing bad.

I send emails to Gordon Ramsay telling him he should be CEO.  Normally, I'd 
kinda look down on fancy foods, but offering three star experince is to be 
respected.  It's something to think about in software.  One time, God said 
bugs were bad because they upset customers.  You might say bugs are sins.  
Tears on Christmas sounds bad.  The Bible says not to ruin the mood when 
someone is cheerful.

God likes soap operas best on TV.  Surely, He likes Ramsay?  I think foods 
glorify the Creator.

God says...
the righteous for silver, and the poor for a pair of shoes; 2:7 That
pant after the dust of the earth on the head of the poor, and turn
aside the way of the meek: and a man and his father will go in unto
the same maid, to profane my holy name: 2:8 And they lay themselves
down upon clothes laid to pledge by every altar, and they drink the
wine of the condemned in the house of their god.

2:9 Yet destroyed I the Amorite before them, whose height was like the
height of the cedars, and he was strong as the oaks; yet I destroyed
his fruit from above, and his roots from beneath.

2:10 Also I brought you up from the land of Egypt, and led you forty
years through the wilderness, to possess the land of the Amorite.

2:11 And I raised up of your sons for prophets, and of your young men
for Nazarites. Is it not even thus, O ye children of Israel? saith the
LORD.

2:12 But ye gave the Nazarites wine to drink; and commanded the
prophets, saying, Prophesy not.

The part about turn aside the meek is about Knights who say Ni.  It's about 
cutting down a tree with a herring.

It could be more serious -- reminds me of Nazis.  Giving the Nazi's wine to 
drink is like encouraging them.

I'm giggling, though.

1:20 And when the king's decree which he shall make shall be published
throughout all his empire, (for it is great,) all the wives shall give
to their husbands honour, both to great and small.

1:21 And the saying pleased the king and the princes; and the king did
according to the word of Memucan: 1:22 For he sent letters into all
the king's provinces, into every province according to the writing
thereof, and to every people after their language, that every man
should bear rule in his own house, and that it should be published
according to the language of every people.

against her.

One guy is talking about pop-up windows.  God said "No" when I started to
make 
child windows back in 2004.  Instead, it has one window per task.  A pop-up

make

offerings of the LORD made by fire, and eat it without leaven beside
the altar: for it is most holy: 10:13 And ye shall eat it in the holy
place, because it is thy due, and thy sons' due, of the sacrifices of
the LORD made by fire: for so I am commanded.

10:14 And the wave breast and heave shoulder shall ye eat in a clean
place; thou, and thy sons, and thy daughters with thee: for they be
thy due, and thy sons' due, which are given out of the sacrifices of
peace offerings of the children of Israel.

10:15 The heave shoulder and the wave breast shall they bring with the
offerings made by fire of the fat, to wave it for a wave offering
before the LORD; and it shall be thine, and thy sons' with thee, by a
statute for ever; as the LORD hath commanded.
