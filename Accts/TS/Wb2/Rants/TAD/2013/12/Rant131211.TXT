The NSA/CIA/FBI wants to extort over and over.  I shoot the hostages.

In 1985, I tried to get a dog to like my dick.

At age 7, Danny got me high on gas fumes and we sucked each other's dick.

I fantasized about Lonni once while masturbaiting.

Paul Keck has an ass that would look good on a woman.
