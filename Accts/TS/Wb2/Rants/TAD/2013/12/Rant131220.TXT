How about a movie where the prisonner is feeling defeated.  Then, one day,
God 
starts talking to Him.  He pauses for a moment, then grins really big and 
says, "How about that!"  It's endless psy-op games, but God is in his corner, 
mostly.  Once in a while it becomes clear there's a cluster-fucked 
combinations of angels at work.

fear of Saul; for Saul and his men compassed David and his men round
about to take them.

23:27 But there came a messenger unto Saul, saying, Haste thee, and
come; for the Philistines have invaded the land.

23:28 Wherefore Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went
against the Philistines: therefore they called that place
Selahammahlekoth.

23:29 And David went up from thence, and dwelt in strong holds at
Engedi.

24:1 And it came to pass, when Saul was returned from following the
Philistines, that it was told him, saying, Behold, David is in the
wilderness of Engedi.

24:2 Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and
went to seek David and his men upon the rocks of the wild goats.

23:16 And as Josiah turned himself, he spied the sepulchres that were
there in the mount, and sent, and took the bones out of the
sepulchres, and burned them upon the altar, and polluted it, according
to the word of the LORD which the man of God proclaimed, who
proclaimed these words.

23:17 Then he said, What title is that that I see? And the men of the
city told him, It is the sepulchre of the man of God, which came from
Judah, and proclaimed these things that thou hast done against the
altar of Bethel.

23:18 And he said, Let him alone; let no man move his bones. So they
let his bones alone, with the bones of the prophet that came out of
Samaria.

23:19 And all the houses also of the high places that were in the
cities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had made to provoke the
Lord to anger, Josiah took away, and did to them according to all the
acts that he had done in Bethel.

"White-washed sepulchre's" is approximately "toilet" in my mind.

23:26 Thou blind Pharisee, cleanse first that which is within the cup
and platter, that the outside of them may be clean also.

23:27 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like
unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are
within full of dead men's bones, and of all uncleanness.

23:28 Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within
ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.

Who's Your favorite 20th century artist, God?  You like soap operas best of

of Uzza: and Amon his son reigned in his stead.

21:19 Amon was twenty and two years old when he began to reign, and he
reigned two years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was
Meshullemeth, the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah.

21:20 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as his
father Manasseh did.

21:21 And he walked in all the way that his father walked in, and
served the idols that his father served, and worshipped them: 21:22
And he forsook the LORD God of his fathers, and walked not in the way
of the LORD.

21:23 And the servants of Amon conspired against him, and slew the
king in his own house.

21:24 And the people of the land slew all them that had conspired
against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king
in his stead.

I have actual extensive experience writing multicore games without a GPU.  I 
don't want this shit.

I'm tired.

I have no use for fantasy processors -- you fight the war with the army you 
have, not what you would like.  It would be akin to masterbation for me to 
indulge in designing my own CPU.

Why don't you ask me what I think of a very nice FPGA-based multicore chip?  
"Shit, this is ghetto depressing.", would be my reaction.

I don't feel like demoing my OS.  It's divine intellect.  I don't think Chuck 
Moore cares about mine anymore than I care about his.

So, the SpaceHog song uses falsetto.  In life you can't always just go by
what 
you like.  I think it's a good song.  I'm not going to issue a judgement -- I 
don't know.

When I had my first programming job, my bosses were really tolerant.  I
cringe 
thinking about how I screwed-up some people's code, being young.

I don't think I ever got negative discipline... almost.  Would have done me 
good!

hand...  wait... God doesn't command much.

GitHub is bad enough when you have networking.  Unless you have people 
operating on the same files at the same time, of course you don't use source 
control!  If you have to shut-down VMware, transfer files, upload or download 
files, uncompress and recompress each file individually, add a HolyC syntax
to 
GitHub so it supports binary graphics in source code, GitHub is not an
option. 
 Ridiculous!

I was just thinking how delightful wooden toys are.  It occurred to me my

I have nostalga for character graphics.  What's that game, Elf fortress?  I 
never played it but it looks cool.

Naw, there's not much justification for character graphics when we have all 
the horsepower that we have.  You can just make a big bitmap of anything and 
scoll it around.  I guess animations, though, might justify it.

I loved Ultima.  The weird thing is... I was young enough to enjoy and grow

thee, and shall serve thee unto the year of jubile.

25:41 And then shall he depart from thee, both he and his children
with him, and shall return unto his own family, and unto the
possession of his fathers shall he return.

33:20 So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his
own house: and Amon his son reigned in his stead.

33:21 Amon was two and twenty years old when he began to reign, and
reigned two years in Jerusalem.

33:22 But he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as did
Manasseh his father: for Amon sacrificed unto all the carved images
which Manasseh his father had made, and served them; 33:23 And humbled
not himself before the LORD, as Manasseh his father had humbled
himself; but Amon trespassed more and more.

33:24 And his servants conspired against him, and slew him in his own
house.

33:25 But the people of the land slew all them that had conspired
against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king
in his stead.

arms of Pharaoh shall fall down; and they shall know that I am the

and he shall stretch it out upon the land of Egypt.

30:26 And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and disperse
them among the countries; and they shall know that I am the LORD.

31:1 And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the third month, in
the first day of the month, that the word of the LORD came unto me,
saying, 31:2 Son of man, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, and to his
multitude; Whom art thou like in thy greatness?  31:3 Behold, the
Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon with fair branches, and with a
shadowing shroud, and of an high stature; and his top was among the
thick boughs.

rivers running round about his plants, and sent her little rivers unto

It's pretty bad to look back and not tell where I went wrong.  Here's what I 
think about.  (Sorry if this is a little bit insensative, but I don't think 
anybody feels too inferior just because of cow's milk.)  Suppose you have a 
trait like being able to drink cow's milk.  For that to become universal, 
almost everybody has to die.  How fast could everybody die and be replaced?  
Blue eyes instead of brown eyes?  When you start to think about the hundreds 
of traits where everybody has to get wiped-out and replaced over and over,
the 
whole thing look suspect without God.  Yeah, it happened, but randomly?

and the altar, that neither they, nor ye also, die.

tabernacle of the congregation, for all the service of the tabernacle:
and a stranger shall not come nigh unto you.

18:5 And ye shall keep the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge of

God has said some gay-tolerant stuff.  It feels like beating a cripple.  When

I don't think pro-gay propaganda should be tolerated.  When gays go around 
drawing penises on things and putting penis drawings in people's faces...

If you can keep it to yourself, it's between you and God, as far as I'm

I asked God what field He was most better than us in.  Economics.  On
climate, 
He laughed at us.

Got any ideas on unemployment, God?  It has to be jobs they will accept.  I 
guess congress is extending unemployment.

One thing I've learned is some people are mean and probably don't realize it.
 
Understandably, many who have jobs want the unemployed to take miserable jobs.

We might have people who are not employable.  If they have the skills of 
Chinese or Vietnamese or Bangladeshi but the cost of living of Americans,
this 
is broken.  I'm not an expert -- I'll gladly leave it to Obama.  If you raise 
the minimum wage, they will simply not be competative and have no job.

In India, I heard the wealthy purposely make everything ineffecient, so that 
more jobs are created.  That makes me furious, but maybe, I have problems. 
If
