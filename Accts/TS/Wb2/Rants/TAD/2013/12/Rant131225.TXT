KingJamesBible: God says...
3:1 A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet upon Shigionoth.

3:2 O LORD, I have heard thy speech, and was afraid: O LORD, revive
thy work in the midst of the years, in the midst of the years make
known; in wrath remember mercy.

3:3 God came from Teman, and the Holy One from mount Paran. Selah. His
glory covered the heavens, and the earth was full of his praise.

3:4 And his brightness was as the light; he had horns coming out of
his hand: and there was the hiding of his power.

3:5 Before him went the pestilence, and burning coals went forth at
his feet.

3:6 He stood, and measured the earth: he beheld, and drove asunder the
nations; and the everlasting mountains were scattered, the perpetual
hills did bow: his ways are everlasting.

Pope's Message #2

I would feel like a loser to say God ever wants war.  However, we are
supposed 
to know God, love God and obey God.  You don't know God at all.  God sees war 
as servicemen competing.

happy about jubile and maybe about my code.  Now, that I reread it... I
donno. 
 I kinda think it's about my code being public domain.  Jubilee is about 
freeing debtors.  My code being public domain is what it means to me.

I have 82,000 line count and can go to 100,000 under my self-imposed limit,
so 
one fifth remains.

Dr Phineas would want code comments added.  <Chuckle>  It could use more 
comments.  Those do count towards the limit.  Writing short comments is just 
as important to me as writing short code.

I want God's temple limited to 100,000 lines of code for all time.

I've done everything I want to do on it.  I'd be open to handing-off to
others 
to maintain it.  Not much can go wrong if they keep the 100,000 line limit, 
640x480x4bit limit, and single-audio-voice limit.  He said a few more things, 
like "no child windows".  What the heck, new people can just talk to God,
too, 
LOL.  One more thing -- it must be perfect, so you always break backward 
compatibility, if it's an issue.  What I want is Microsoft and VMware to 
support RedSea file system in place of FAT32 and ISO9660.  I also want them
to 
support the GRA file format.

                                   Demands

When God is manifest to the World and He claims this operating system, 
publically, here's what I want:

* VMware to again support PC Speaker and provide emulation if no PC Speaker
is 
present.

* Windows and Linux will support [C:/Doc/RedSea.TXT.Z,1] RedSea file system
so I can get rid of 2,000 
lines of redundant, blemished code -- FAT32 and ISO9660.  God's temple must
be 
perfect.
[C:/Kernel/Dsk/FileSysRedSea.CPP.Z,1]
[C:/Kernel/Dsk/FileSysFAT.CPP.Z,1]	:1004
[C:/Kernel/Dsk/FileSysISO1.CPP.Z,1]	:306
[C:/Adam/Boot/DskCDDVD.CPP.Z,1]	:536

* No secure boot.  TempleOS is a additional operating system that must be
used 
along-side Windows or Linux.  It must dual boot.

* Mandate to PC hardware manufacturers: ATA/ATAPI PIO must work.

* PS2 emulated Keyboard and Mouse must work.  The BIOS must enable these.

* VMware should allow ATAPI to connect real CD/DVD hardware.

* Perhaps, VMware can enable faster than standard x86 IN/OUT instruction 
timing for ATA/ATAPI PIO, so the bandwidth isn't as bad.

* VMware and others should list TempleOS as one of the official 64-bit 
operating systems.

* Windows and Linux should support TempleOS .GRA graphics files.  These are 
just right-side-up .BMP files with 8-bit pixs 4-bits of color and 
transparency, with no palette.  Compression comes from the
[C:/Doc/RedSea.TXT.Z,1] RedSea .Z LZW 
compression.  (Let me know when you want it.)  [C:/Adam/Gr/GrDC.CPP.Z,284]
DCSave(), [C:/Adam/Gr/GrDC.CPP.Z,354] GRAWrite(), [C:/Adam/Gr/GrDC.CPP.Z,323]
DCLoad(), 
and [C:/Adam/Gr/GrDC.CPP.Z,365] GRARead().  [C:/Kernel/Compress.CPP.Z,1]




In other words, all hardware and BIOSes must support TempleOS as a native and 
as a virtual system, dual booted with Windows or Linux.

It would be neat if TempleOS were burned into BIOS ROMs.  My hope is that it 
will be finished and largely unchanging.  I need a good dictionary, first.  
Maybe, we leave the dictionary out.

I do not intend to ever support UEFI.  That monstrocity uses elf and various 
propriatary graphics formats.

KingJamesBible: God says...
5:24 And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the
affections and lusts.

5:25 If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.

5:26 Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another,
envying one another.

6:1 Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are
spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering
thyself, lest thou also be tempted.

6:2 Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.

6:3 For if a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he
deceiveth himself.

6:4 But let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have
rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another.

I must explain a core value.  I code with a vision of a C64 with a 100000
line 
of code limit, not a NASA main frame.  [C:/Kernel/StrPrint.CPP.Z,247]
SPrintJoin() does not handle corner 
cases and would be scorned by NASA, but it captures the ethos.  You cannot 
[C:/Kernel/StrScan.CPP.Z,349] Scan( [C:/Kernel/StrPrint.CPP.Z,946]
Print([C:/Kernel/StrScan.CPP.Z,349] Scan())) and get the same result.  I
don't care.  It's fast and 
simple.  We are not a Unix, we are a C64.

Overrated People

I wrote all 120,796 lines of code.  I designed everything with God's help.  I 
made it look easy.  Half the time, I'm faced with psychiatric CIA nurses who 
say I didn't do it, other times I'm faced with people who aren't impressed.

I am God's chosen one.

Looking back at Ticketmaster, I don't view my work as good.  Also, I'm 
slightly less impressed with the people, now that I'm older and wiser.

2:22 And they went, and came unto the mountain, and abode there three
days, until the pursuers were returned: and the pursuers sought them
throughout all the way, but found them not.

2:23 So the two men returned, and descended from the mountain, and
passed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and told him all
things that befell them: 2:24 And they said unto Joshua, Truly the
LORD hath delivered into our hands all the land; for even all the
inhabitants of the country do faint because of us.

3:1 And Joshua rose early in the morning; and they removed from
Shittim, and came to Jordan, he and all the children of Israel, and
lodged there before they passed over.

3:2 And it came to pass after three days, that the officers went
through the host; 3:3 And they commanded the people, saying, When ye
see the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, and the priests the
Levites bearing it, then ye shall remove from your place, and go after
it.
