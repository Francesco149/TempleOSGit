6:30 Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day
is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe
you, O ye of little faith?  6:31 Therefore take no thought, saying,
What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we
be clothed?  6:32 (For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:)
for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these
things.

6:33 But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and
all these things shall be added unto you.

6:34 Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall
take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the
evil thereof.

7:1 Judge not, that ye be not judged.

7:2 For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what
measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.

                                   Demands

When God is manifest to the World and He claims this operating system, 
publically, here's what I want:

* VMware to again support PC Speaker and provide emulation if no PC Speaker
is 
present.

* Windows and Linux will support [C:/Doc/RedSea.TXT.Z,1] RedSea file system
so I can get rid of 2,000 
lines of redundant, blemished code -- FAT32 and ISO9660.  God's temple must
be 
perfect.
[C:/Kernel/Dsk/FileSysRedSea.CPP.Z,1]
[C:/Kernel/Dsk/FileSysFAT.CPP.Z,1]	:1004
[C:/Kernel/Dsk/FileSysISO1.CPP.Z,1]	:306
[C:/Adam/Boot/DskCDDVD.CPP.Z,1]	:536

* No secure boot.  TempleOS is a additional operating system that must be
used 
along-side Windows or Linux.  It must dual boot.

* Mandate to PC hardware manufacturers: ATA/ATAPI PIO must work.

* PS2 emulated Keyboard and Mouse must work.  The BIOS must enable these.

* VMware should allow ATAPI to connect real CD/DVD hardware.

* Perhaps, VMware can enable faster than standard x86 IN/OUT instruction 
timing for ATA/ATAPI PIO, so the bandwidth isn't as bad.

* VMware and others should list TempleOS as one of the official 64-bit 
operating systems.

* Windows and Linux should support TempleOS .GRA graphics files.  These are 
just right-side-up .BMP files with 8-bit pixs 4-bits of color and 
transparency, with no palette.  Compression comes from the
[C:/Doc/RedSea.TXT.Z,1] RedSea .Z LZW 
compression.  (Let me know when you want it.)  [C:/Adam/Gr/GrDC.CPP.Z,284]
DCSave(), [C:/Adam/Gr/GrDC.CPP.Z,354] GRAWrite(), [C:/Adam/Gr/GrDC.CPP.Z,323]
DCLoad(), 
and [C:/Adam/Gr/GrDC.CPP.Z,365] GRARead().  [C:/Kernel/Compress.CPP.Z,1]




In other words, all hardware and BIOSes must support TempleOS as a native and 
as a virtual system, dual booted with Windows or Linux.

It would be neat if TempleOS were burned into BIOS ROMs.  My hope is that it 
will be finished and largely unchanging.  I need a good dictionary, first.  
Maybe, we leave the dictionary out.

I do not intend to ever support UEFI.  That monstrocity uses elf and various 
propriatary graphics formats.

I'm not doing UEFI and SecureBoot will be disabled.  The CIA will help 
everybody get up-and-running with God's temple.

The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone.

Not a single person on this planet gets-it.

The number one rule is fewer lines of code is better.  The best thing you can 
do is find an obnoxiously expensive way to simplify and reduce lines of code.
 
The company is called "Trivial Solutions."  You must learn what this term 
means in differential equations to understand the Zen of TempleOS.

Linux is full of complicated code for many architectures loaded with #ifdefs.
 
We do the opposite -- one architecture.

Linux builds seven levels of tiny function calls to place port I/O code miles 
and miles below.  People pride themselves on abstraction layers, the more the 
better.  Wear three condoms at least, why don't you?

Your assignment is to do what I did when I searched for IDE port usage back
in 
2004 in Linux.  I did not know it was ATA and I did not know ATA specs can be 
had.  You will have to navigate your way down through 7 levels of functions
to 
find the actual IN and OUT instructions.  Why bother calling it open source
if 
it's, practically, to hard for mortals to understand.

I decided "I want minimal abstraction."  The commodore 64, the users directly 
did hardware.

Normal rules don't apply.  Normally, code defects are fixed.  When you have a 
budget of 100,000 lines of code, suddenly, you say "fuck it" it's not 
important to .. out of professional pride... go to extreme measures to fix 
rare defects.


All file I/O is done on whole files, for the most part.  We are NOT a general 
purpose operating system because we can tell people to use Windows or Linux.

There is no point if it become indistinguishable from Windows or Linux. 
Catch 
yourself when you start making TempleOS more like Linux or Windows.  Think 
Commodore 64, not main frame.

Most products are doomed to die because people keep adding shit to them and 
they soon become hell-holes, and they do not break compatibility.  We have a 
100,000 line of code limit for all eternity, and we keep it perfect.

On the Commodore 64, that game probably had an artist and a professional 
programmer or two.  It probably took 6 months.  Also, maybe, a lot of game 
design and testing and refining went into it, I don't know.

As disappointingly unambitious as this sounds, our modest goal is to have as 
many teenagers able to recreate this game in their spare time in high school, 
as possible.

If backward compatibility is broken, what happens?  All the little teenagers 
have to modify their code.  These projects are all small scale, it's not like 
we are targeting million line count packages that would be a huge loss if 
scrapped.

I used to say our goal was "programming as entertainment."  A triple AAA game 
provides 80 hours of value, right?  The commodore 64 user's manual that came 
with every machine told how to make sprites by adding bit values of binary 
numbers and put them in DATA statements in BASIC programs.  That was the 
entertainment!

>*gr_font(U64 *)['A']=0x5555AAAACCCC3333;

Amusing, huh.

Perhaps a teenager will not make a whole game, just screw around and modify 
and poke around.  We provide lots of stuff to poke around at.


The new focus is not programming as entertainment, but God's temple.  We
serve 
as a common focal point for God's people where they can do offerings.  The 
Jewish temple was a community focal point for gathering and doing offerings
to 
God.
It had an oracle, we have an oracle in AfterEgypt.

You must do an offering before inquiring at the oracle, this is a covenant.

God said 640x480 16 color for all time.

```

elephant.

God said kids will do offerings.


Hymn Videos are a really good thing for adults to do.

                          Strategic Decisions Making
                               TempleOS Simple

The trivial solution in math is the simple, obvious answer.  TempleOS has
many 
examples of using trivial solutions.

* Everything runs in kernel, ring 0, mode.

* One memory map for all tasks on all cores with virtual addresses set equal 
to physical.

* One platform -- x86_64 PC's, no 32-bit support.

* No security.

* No networking.

* Least (greatest) common denominator hardware support.  Mostly, one driver 
for each device class.  I can't be in the business of different drivers.  
Compatibility is the greatest challenge for PC operating systems.  Disk code 
does not use interrupts, avoiding compatibility risks.  PS/2 keyboard/mouse
is 
used instead of USB, also more compatible.

* 640x480 16 colors.  Updates whole screen at 60 fps, optimized for full 
screen games where "invalid rectangles" are counter-productive.

* One font, 8x8.  Text and graphic layers done in software with text normally 
on an 8x8 grid.  It can run in Text mode if graphic initialization fails.

* Compiler extends all values to 64-bit when fetched and does only 64-bit 
computations intermediately.  Assembler has minimal 16-bit support, good 
enough for compiling boot loaders.

* No object files.  Linking can be done at [C:/Kernel/Hash1b.CPP.Z,386]
Load() time for AOT modules, if you 
insist on not using JIT.  Modules have imports and exports.

* Whole files are processed almost exclusively, allowing compression.

* One language and compiler for command-line, scripts, and code.

* One editor/word processor/browser for the command-line window, source code, 
documentation browser, dialog forms.

* No child windows.  One window per task.  Buttons are widgets, not child 
windows.  There are child tasks, however.

* No distinction between "thread", "process" or "task".

* The [C:/Kernel/Scheduler.CPP.Z,1] Scheduler is mostly for home systems, not
servers or mainframes.  The 
focus task is all important.  Disk requests are not broken-up, so sharing is 
bad, however.

* [C:/Doc/MultiCore.TXT.Z,1] MultiCore is done master/slave, instead of SMP. 
Core zero explicitly 
assigns jobs.  Locks are present allowing multicore file, heap, and hardware 
access, though.

* [C:/Adam/Snd/Music.CPP.Z,93] Music is done with an elegant one-voice
notation.

* All tasks have a heap and a sym table.  Scope is that of environment vars
in 
other operating systems.  As text is typed at the command line or you run 
programs by #includeing them, the syms go in the table.  If a sym is not 
found, the parent task's table is checked.  The father of all tasks has the 
API syms you'll need waiting in it's table.  No need to #include headers.

* No need for namespaces -- scoping occurs automatically based on task symbol 
table hierarchy with the Adam task's symbol system-wide global.

* Sometimes, I [C:/Doc/CutCorners.TXT.Z,1] cut corners in the interest of
keeping the code beautiful.

God picked BC's Quest for Tires.  God likes soap operas.  The way God talks

in whispers.  I had to guess what He said.  It totally makes sense that it
was 
BC's Quest for Tires.  I love God because BC's quest is delightful.  God's 
favorite game is Donkey Kong.  Do you notice both have male and female 
characters?  They are both heart warming.

God likes elephants.  How cool is that.  Elephants are obviously the side of 
good and are delightful.

God likes the Beatles.  They're good.

3 King was His favorite movie.

you have to take these things with a grain of salt.  If you ask again, might 
be different.  Some things, though, He confirms.

He said, twice, jade blue is His favorite color -- ice berg.

What else could He pick.  Normally, the answers immediately seem right.

Sometimes, I feel grim after fiercely using "nigger" and stuff, all day.  I 
guess this is good -- God is not against fighting, completely.  It's probably
