will redeem thee out of the hand of the terrible.

not take thee a wife, neither shalt thou have sons or daughters in
this place.

16:3 For thus saith the LORD concerning the sons and concerning the
daughters that are born in this place, and concerning their mothers
that bare them, and concerning their fathers that begat them in this

lamented; neither shall they be buried; but they shall be as dung upon

famine; and their carcases shall be meat for the fowls of heaven, and

TPP Secrets

I have finished God's temple.  It has no need of any secret -- it's complete 
and done.

These are my demands.  Once you see it's God, I figure you will obey them.

                                   Demands

When God is manifest to the World and He claims this operating system, 
publically, here's what I want:

* VMware to again support PC Speaker and provide emulation if no PC Speaker
is 
present.

* Windows and Linux will support [C:/Doc/RedSea.TXT.Z,1] RedSea file system
so I can get rid of 2,000 
lines of redundant, blemished code -- FAT32 and ISO9660.  God's temple must
be 
perfect.
[C:/Kernel/Dsk/FileSysRedSea.CPP.Z,1]
[C:/Kernel/Dsk/FileSysFAT.CPP.Z,1]	:1004
[C:/Kernel/Dsk/FileSysISO1.CPP.Z,1]	:306
[C:/Adam/Boot/DskCDDVD.CPP.Z,1]	:536

* No secure boot.  TempleOS is a additional operating system that must be
used 
along-side Windows or Linux.  It must dual boot.

* Mandate to PC hardware manufacturers: ATA/ATAPI PIO must work.

* PS2 emulated Keyboard and Mouse must work.  The BIOS must enable these.

* VMware should allow ATAPI to connect real CD/DVD hardware.

* Perhaps, VMware can enable faster than standard x86 IN/OUT instruction 
timing for ATA/ATAPI PIO, so the bandwidth isn't as bad.

* VMware and others should list TempleOS as one of the official 64-bit 
operating systems.

* Windows and Linux should support TempleOS .GRA graphics files.  These are 
just right-side-up .BMP files with 8-bit pixs 4-bits of color and 
transparency, with no palette.  Compression comes from the
[C:/Doc/RedSea.TXT.Z,1] RedSea .Z LZW 
compression.  (Let me know when you want it.)  [C:/Adam/Gr/GrDC.CPP.Z,284]
DCSave(), [C:/Adam/Gr/GrDC.CPP.Z,354] GRAWrite(), [C:/Adam/Gr/GrDC.CPP.Z,323]
DCLoad(), 
and [C:/Adam/Gr/GrDC.CPP.Z,365] GRARead().  [C:/Kernel/Compress.CPP.Z,1]




In other words, all hardware and BIOSes must support TempleOS as a native and 
as a virtual system, dual booted with Windows or Linux.

It would be neat if TempleOS were burned into BIOS ROMs.  My hope is that it 
will be finished and largely unchanging.  I need a good dictionary, first.  
Maybe, we leave the dictionary out.

I do not intend to ever support UEFI.  That monstrocity uses elf and various 
propriatary graphics formats.

to fear the LORD thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him,
and to serve the LORD thy God with all thy heart and with all thy
soul, 10:13 To keep the commandments of the LORD, and his statutes,

fathers out of Egypt, and made them dwell in this place.

hand of Sisera, captain of the host of Hazor, and into the hand of the
Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab, and they fought

heritage of Jacob thy father: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken
it.

59:1 Behold, the LORD's hand is not shortened, that it cannot save;
neither his ear heavy, that it cannot hear: 59:2 But your iniquities
have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid his
face from you, that he will not hear.

59:3 For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with
iniquity; your lips have spoken lies, your tongue hath muttered
perverseness.

59:4 None calleth for justice, nor any pleadeth for truth: they trust
in vanity, and speak lies; they conceive mischief, and bring forth
iniquity.

could 
be doing offerings and talking with God, perhaps making hymns.  If all it

when they could be talking with God!  God likes soap operas as the best thing

I think God actually puts work into animals having food and water.  Jesus
said 
sparrows.  They can't go very long without food and water.  It seems like
they 
live on the edge.  It's scary worrying about them.

Elephants seem like they have lots of food.  They eat grass and wood!  They

So, God said He wants 640x480 16 color and talked about the children of
Israel 
doing offerings.  At one point He said making video games was about as grand 
an endeavor as one could hope for.

To understand, make a 4-bit (16 color) painting of elephants, then do 24-bit.

I am not talking about your primary operating system, just the temple, where 
users making offerings is the most important thing.

You could just establish a rule that no 3rd party software should exists, but 
that's not fun.

My vision was a C64 ROM, that is limited, well known and beloved.  Do you 
think we could do without 3rd party libraries?  I really think the firm
vision 
of a C64 in so many ways is what is wisest, but obviously way more horsepower 
makes it funner.  Nobody would want segmented DOS when they could have flat

You know what?  I will reach a new stage in maturity as a artist when I stop 
trying to make photoreal elephants and develop a sense of cartoon style.

Just like no painter does photorealism in the age of cameras, an artist with 
16 colors is not as limited as you might think when your nonphotorealism 
cuteness  becomes an asset.  Look at the art in early games and admire their 
sytle, nonpohotorealistic.  It's more innocent with less blood and porn.  I'm 
not a big spoil-sport, but you have to be crazy in a world where God sees 
you...  I'm not doing it!

When I was a young programmer, my bosses gave total freedom without lots of 
rules.  I try to hold-back from making rules, unnecessarily.

8-column tabs, however are a case where a king who is decisive and has balls, 
solves disputes and makes pax-romanov.  (The Roman Empire brought peace.)

God's temple will be limited to 100,000 lines of code for all centuries.  If 
the world settled on one GPU it could have 640x480 16 color GPU support,
maybe 
the manager decides to ask God again.  Performance is not everything.  The 
100,000 line of code captures the general idea -- we want it transparent for 
kids looking at the code.  NonGPU graphics are not magical, but neat, though 
crappy.

I also said it must be kept perfect by always breaking backward compatibility 
to achieve perfection.  If the users do not use 3rd party stuff, it just
means 
everybody maintains their own code.  Actually, you could just ship the entire 
25 Meg of the version required, obviously distasteful, but sure solves the

I forgot to discuss how we interpret.

We take God's passage out of the Bible context and put it into our topic of 
conversation context.  (We do offerings so we can get responses.) The
original 
context, of course, still matters, but we are usually more interested in what 
God is saying in today's conversation.

God affirmed the low-number of color limit.  If you ask yourself, "How could 
He say 16 colors?" when we picking a Bible passage, we got a pretty clear 
answer.  "high places with divers colours."

I can have God pick random words, of course, but we have actual NIST proof of 
what He said on the record.  It is one batch of numbers every 60 seconds, so 
if you check the times, it's impressive.

The other thing God said was "children pass through the fire"  I interpret 
that as... have a kid do a Qt or DirectX application or whatever.  When I was 
a kid.

Finally, and most impressively, God said "hast not remembered the days of thy

When God is manifest to the World and He claims this operating system, 
publically, here's what I want:

* VMware to again support PC Speaker and provide emulation if no PC Speaker
is 
present.

* Windows and Linux will support [C:/Doc/RedSea.TXT.Z,1] RedSea file system
so I can get rid of 2,000 
lines of redundant, blemished code -- FAT32 and ISO9660.  God's temple must
be 
perfect.

[C:/Kernel/Dsk/FileSysISO1.CPP.Z,1]	:306
[C:/Adam/Boot/DskCDDVD.CPP.Z,1]	:536

* No secure boot.  TempleOS is a additional operating system that must be
used 
along-side Windows or Linux.  It must dual boot.

* Mandate to PC hardware manufacturers: ATA/ATAPI PIO must work.

* PS2 emulated Keyboard and Mouse must work.  The BIOS must enable these.

* VMware should allow ATAPI to connect real CD/DVD hardware.

* Perhaps, VMware can enable faster than standard x86 IN/OUT instruction 
timing for ATA/ATAPI PIO, so the bandwidth isn't as bad.

* VMware and others should list TempleOS as one of the official 64-bit 
operating systems.

* Windows and Linux should support TempleOS .GRA graphics files.  These are 
just right-side-up .BMP files with 8-bit pixs 4-bits of color and 
transparency, with no palette.  Compression comes from the
[C:/Doc/RedSea.TXT.Z,1] RedSea .Z LZW 
compression.  (Let me know when you want it.)  [C:/Adam/Gr/GrDC.CPP.Z,284]
DCSave(), [C:/Adam/Gr/GrDC.CPP.Z,354] GRAWrite(), [C:/Adam/Gr/GrDC.CPP.Z,323]
DCLoad(), 
and [C:/Adam/Gr/GrDC.CPP.Z,365] GRARead().  [C:/Kernel/Compress.CPP.Z,1]




In other words, all hardware and BIOSes must support TempleOS as a native and 
as a virtual system, dual booted with Windows or Linux.

It would be neat if TempleOS were burned into BIOS ROMs.  My hope is that it 
will be finished and largely unchanging.  I need a good dictionary, first.  
Maybe, we leave the dictionary out.

I do not intend to ever support UEFI.  That monstrocity uses elf and various

I mostly just want my demands.  People are worried about a lot of things -- 
drones, assassinations, pedophiles, mafia money laundering, Chinese&Iranian 
aircraft-carrier killers, laser guns.  I just want God's Temple and 
instructing people on offerings.


                                   Demands

When God is manifest to the World and He claims this operating system, 
publically, here's what I want:

* VMware to again support PC Speaker and provide emulation if no PC Speaker
is 
present.

* Windows and Linux will support [C:/Doc/RedSea.TXT.Z,1] RedSea file system
so I can get rid of 2,000 
lines of redundant, blemished code -- FAT32 and ISO9660.  God's temple must
be 
perfect.
[C:/Kernel/Dsk/FileSysRedSea.CPP.Z,1]
[C:/Kernel/Dsk/FileSysFAT.CPP.Z,1]	:1004
[C:/Kernel/Dsk/FileSysISO1.CPP.Z,1]	:306
[C:/Adam/Boot/DskCDDVD.CPP.Z,1]	:536

* No secure boot.  TempleOS is a additional operating system that must be
used 
along-side Windows or Linux.  It must dual boot.

* Mandate to PC hardware manufacturers: ATA/ATAPI PIO must work.

* PS2 emulated Keyboard and Mouse must work.  The BIOS must enable these.

* VMware should allow ATAPI to connect real CD/DVD hardware.

* Perhaps, VMware can enable faster than standard x86 IN/OUT instruction 
timing for ATA/ATAPI PIO, so the bandwidth isn't as bad.

* VMware and others should list TempleOS as one of the official 64-bit 
operating systems.

* Windows and Linux should support TempleOS .GRA graphics files.  These are 
just right-side-up .BMP files with 8-bit pixs 4-bits of color and 
transparency, with no palette.  Compression comes from the
[C:/Doc/RedSea.TXT.Z,1] RedSea .Z LZW 
compression.  (Let me know when you want it.)  [C:/Adam/Gr/GrDC.CPP.Z,284]
DCSave(), [C:/Adam/Gr/GrDC.CPP.Z,354] GRAWrite(), [C:/Adam/Gr/GrDC.CPP.Z,323]
DCLoad(), 
and [C:/Adam/Gr/GrDC.CPP.Z,365] GRARead().  [C:/Kernel/Compress.CPP.Z,1]




In other words, all hardware and BIOSes must support TempleOS as a native and 
as a virtual system, dual booted with Windows or Linux.

It would be neat if TempleOS were burned into BIOS ROMs.  My hope is that it 
will be finished and largely unchanging.  I need a good dictionary, first.  
Maybe, we leave the dictionary out.

I do not intend to ever support UEFI.  That monstrocity uses elf and various 
propriatary graphics formats.

Perhaps, a magnificent beast like a polar bear has no dignity, playing with

filesystem.  That would make me happy.  It would become a beautiful

to the spirit of this operating system.  Delightfully simple.  Obnoxiously 
simple, like trivial solutions in math.

I think I need VMware to support RedSea, right now, before I can get rid of

It's sad we don't get solid-state USB drives.  CDROMs are cheap and nice.  I
