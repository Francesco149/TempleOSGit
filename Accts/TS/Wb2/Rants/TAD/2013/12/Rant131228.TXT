The people at OSDev like to brag about how little memory their operating 
systems use.  If you went to a store and one operating system used 250Meg of 
RAM and another operating system used 1Gig which would you buy?

The market belongs to people who can make new usage of new technology to do 
new things.  My new usage is simpler code and lower line-count everywhere.  I 
load whole files instead of parts of files.  My code is simpler and I can do 
individual file compression.  File compression does not work on incremental 
file access.

I broke-out my HolyC lexical analyser for parsing a text file.  It produces a 
stream of C tokens.  It's nice if you know how to use it.

26:54 To many thou shalt give the more inheritance, and to few thou
shalt give the less inheritance: to every one shall his inheritance be
given according to those that were numbered of him.

26:55 Notwithstanding the land shall be divided by lot: according to
the names of the tribes of their fathers they shall inherit.

26:56 According to the lot shall the possession thereof be divided
between many and few.

26:57 And these are they that were numbered of the Levites after their
families: of Gershon, the family of the Gershonites: of Kohath, the
family of the Kohathites: of Merari, the family of the Merarites.

26:58 These are the families of the Levites: the family of the
Libnites, the family of the Hebronites, the family of the Mahlites,
the family of the Mushites, the family of the Korathites. And Kohath

Someone says income went up for rich, but stayed the same for poor.

99% of the wealth is owned by the top 1%?  We redistribute and everybody has 
100 times more money, except the 1%.  Everybody can by 100 cars and 100 
houses?

The moral of the story is to look at goods and services, not money in the 
bank.  If you gave 1 billion dollars to Bill Gates, what would happen?  He 
would invest it and not change his consumption of goods and services.  If you 
gave 1 billion dollars as $1,000 to a million poor people, they would buy 
goods and services.

The only way to raise standard of living to to be more productive.  If there 
is 7% unemployment, you might put 3% back to work and 3% more goods and 
services would exist.  That is the best a politician could ever do.  An 
engineer, however, could invent something and boost productivity.

I used to buy CD's of music in the 90's.  Now, I go to YouTube.  I am rich!  
Cell phones did not exist.  Poor people have technology that did not exist.  
How fucken dare you not say life has improved!  Standard of living has gone 
way up for all people, especially people in Africa who have cell phones.

hath not wrought by me, to make the Gentiles obedient, by word and
deed, 15:19 Through mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the
Spirit of God; so that from Jerusalem, and round about unto Illyricum,
I have fully preached the gospel of Christ.

and in thine hand is power and might; and in thine hand it is to make
great, and to give strength unto all.

29:13 Now therefore, our God, we thank thee, and praise thy glorious
name.

29:14 But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to
offer so willingly after this sort? for all things come of thee, and
of thine own have we given thee.

29:15 For we are strangers before thee, and sojourners, as were all
our fathers: our days on the earth are as a shadow, and there is none
abiding.

29:16 O LORD our God, all this store that we have prepared to build
thee an house for thine holy name cometh of thine hand, and is all
thine own.

29:17 I know also, my God, that thou triest the heart, and hast

This makes me very smug.

8:57 The LORD our God be with us, as he was with our fathers: let him
not leave us, nor forsake us: 8:58 That he may incline our hearts unto
him, to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and his
statutes, and his judgments, which he commanded our fathers.

8:59 And let these my words, wherewith I have made supplication before
the LORD, be nigh unto the LORD our God day and night, that he
maintain the cause of his servant, and the cause of his people Israel
at all times, as the matter shall require: 8:60 That all the people of
the earth may know that the LORD is God, and that there is none else.

8:61 Let your heart therefore be perfect with the LORD our God, to
walk in his statutes, and to keep his commandments, as at this day.

8:62 And the king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice before
the LORD.

8:63 And Solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings, which he

An intelligent answer on C over ASM.  So little of what's on OSDev I agree 
with.

Mine started as 100% TASM.  I wrote a JIT compiler for my command-line.  I 
converted as much as I could to HolyC.  I optimized my compiler over ten 
years.

There's a reason the whole world no longer programs in ASM, LOL.

Tell us about Your ASM language, God!

15:11 Then three thousand men of Judah went to the top of the rock
Etam, and said to Samson, Knowest thou not that the Philistines are
rulers over us? what is this that thou hast done unto us? And he said
unto them, As they did unto me, so have I done unto them.

15:12 And they said unto him, We are come down to bind thee, that we
may deliver thee into the hand of the Philistines. And Samson said
unto them, Swear unto me, that ye will not fall upon me yourselves.

15:13 And they spake unto him, saying, No; but we will bind thee fast,
and deliver thee into their hand: but surely we will not kill thee.
And they bound him with two new cords, and brought him up from the
rock.

15:14 And when he came unto Lehi, the Philistines shouted against him:
and the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and the cords that
were upon his arms became as flax that was burnt with fire, and his
bands loosed from off his hands.

15:15 And he found a new jawbone of an ass, and put forth his hand,

Do you think He talked his way to victory alegorically?  He talked like an
ass 
and won arguments or ... infuriated his enemies, but won, LOL.

It's probably not literal.

It's delightful that the Bible has superheros, though.  I wuv God.

8:53 And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead.

8:54 And he put them all out, and took her by the hand, and called,
saying, Maid, arise.

8:55 And her spirit came again, and she arose straightway: and he
commanded to give her meat.

8:56 And her parents were astonished: but he charged them that they
should tell no man what was done.

9:1 Then he called his twelve disciples together, and gave them power
and authority over all devils, and to cure diseases.

9:2 And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the
sick.

9:3 And he said unto them, Take nothing for your journey, neither
staves, nor scrip, neither bread, neither money; neither have two
coats apiece.
