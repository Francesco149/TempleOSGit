If you went to a magic show and they said, "It's real."  There is absoluetly 
no way you can convince anyone.  You could have really really powerful voodoo 
and nobody would blink an eye, even if you insisted it was real.

The problem is nobody know well enough to judge.

If the devil announces God frauds were around doing insane computer viruses, 
there is no way you can ever reach the sheep.

We have mid-level CIA interrogators watching.  They might be 70 percentil 
individuals, smarter than 70% of average poeple, but not gonna help.

Randomly open a book.

God says...
and the hoods, and the vails.

3:24 And it shall come to pass, that instead of sweet smell there
shall be stink; and instead of a girdle a rent; and instead of well
set hair baldness; and instead of a stomacher a girding of sackcloth;
and burning instead of beauty.

3:25 Thy men shall fall by the sword, and thy mighty in the war.

3:26 And her gates shall lament and mourn; and she being desolate
shall sit upon the ground.

4:1 And in that day seven women shall take hold of one man, saying, We
will eat our own bread, and wear our own apparel: only let us be
called by thy name, to take away our reproach.

4:2 In that day shall the branch of the LORD be beautiful and
glorious, and the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and comely for
them that are escaped of Israel.

God gets the last laugh.

I was imagining people smarter than my parents.  It would help if I pictured 
someone like Brock Danielson -- some actual person.  Then, I could see the 
magic show problem.

I said "Voodoo".  That was an exaduration, sort-of.

Spirituality is seen as ignorant by most people.

If you ask people what magic they actually believe in, most Christians would 
say "no" to everything you might ask.

There are some things which are more unbelievable.

Voodoo ranks as a dubious and contemptible category.  Racism, for good reason.

A person like me has to explain that mine is not contemptible, but 
respectible.
This makes me half hearted.  Sigh.  Do I have to? I don't like being 
desperate.

I like not being desperate.  If God's words could ever be good enough on
their 
own, that'd be neat.  Not gonna happen.

The devil can blame subconscious for Ouija board, and I find it reasonable.  
If He blames subconscious for opening randomly a book... that's hard to 
beleive -- my brain can control page that is opened with my fingers?  If I 
open a book I've never read, it is obviously not my subconscious.  If I stop
a 
400Mhz time, not subconscious.  It's tough to convince people.

Quantum random number sites solve the brain problem.  Now, we have NSA doing 
it, problem.  You are the NSA!  Fuck you.  You know it's not you.

God says...
14:32 And the people flew upon the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen,
and calves, and slew them on the ground: and the people did eat them

14:33 Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against the
LORD, in that they eat with the blood. And he said, Ye have
transgressed: roll a great stone unto me this day.

14:34 And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say
unto them, Bring me hither every man his ox, and every man his sheep,
and slay them here, and eat; and sin not against the LORD in eating
with the blood.

And all the people brought every man his ox with him that night, and
slew them there.

altar that he built unto the LORD.

They say I own NIST.  I do 6 other quantum random number sites.  They say I

4:15 And when Aaron and his sons have made an end of covering the
sanctuary, and all the vessels of the sanctuary, as the camp is to set

they shall not touch any holy thing, lest they die. These things are
the burden of the sons of Kohath in the tabernacle of the

meat offering, and the anointing oil, and the oversight of all the
tabernacle, and of all that therein is, in the sanctuary, and in the
vessels thereof.

not off the tribe of the families of the Kohathites from among the
Levites: 4:19 But thus do unto them, that they may live, and not die,
when they approach unto the most holy things: Aaron and his sons shall

There are 7 billion people.  If you had computer monitors 1000x1000 pixels, 
there would be a million pixels on each monitor.  If you lined-up 7000 
monitors, you would be one pixel.

Am I special, like Jesus Christ was special?

This is a trick question.  The obvious answer would be "of course not", but
if 
we are the center of our own reality, it's okay.  The movie, The Matrix, had 
something.

I took philosophy courses.  They suggested there might be a actual material 
world and then a world of illusions (ideas) that each of us sees.

Perhaps, God bends our reality so each of us is special in our own reality.

Where does that leave us.  Every day I fight hard against the same doubters 
and evil fucks.  The enemy burtalizes me, psychologically -- he is vicious
and 
aggressive.  He tries to hurt me deeply very viciously, all the time.  I get 
stupid and forget how evil he is.  Don't take your eye off of him -- the

just pretends.  He is filled with hate, for some reason, a pathetic slave to

and reverenced Haman: for the king had so commanded concerning him.
But Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence.

3:3 Then the king's servants, which were in the king's gate, said unto
Mordecai, Why transgressest thou the king's commandment?  3:4 Now it
came to pass, when they spake daily unto him, and he hearkened not
unto them, that they told Haman, to see whether Mordecai's matters
would stand: for he had told them that he was a Jew.

3:5 And when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence,
then was Haman full of wrath.

shewed him the people of Mordecai: wherefore Haman sought to destroy

that which was spoken unto you by God, saying, 22:32 I am the God of

wheels, and with an assembly of people, which shall set against thee
buckler and shield and helmet round about: and I will set judgment
before them, and they shall judge thee according to their judgments.

Not me.

But, I remember inner tubes and swimming, LOL.

God says...
26:43 The land also shall be left of them, and shall enjoy her
sabbaths, while she lieth desolate without them: and they shall accept
of the punishment of their iniquity: because, even because they
despised my judgments, and because their soul abhorred my statutes.

26:44 And yet for all that, when they be in the land of their enemies,
I will not cast them away, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them
utterly, and to break my covenant with them: for I am the LORD their
God.

26:45 But I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their
ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight
of the heathen, that I might be their God: I am the LORD.

26:46 These are the statutes and judgments and laws, which the LORD
made between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by the hand
of Moses.

27:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 27:2 Speak unto the
children of Israel, and say unto them, When a man shall make a

Extortion seems Jewish.  I think homos like extortion -- it's not manly, it's 
womanly.  Jews are fierce in ways that are ugly.  A lawyer might set a trap.  
"Gothcha"  Tricky and scheming, I guess. Sometimes, God is entertained, but 
perhaps, justice richochets and they don't finish ahead, but God is 
entertained.

I like Zuckerberg.  If I say more, it will get negative.

What's God think?  Zuckerberg's had lots of public shaming.  Chump change by 
my standards, LOL.

God says...
and lay the wood in order upon the fire: 1:8 And the priests, Aaron's
sons, shall lay the parts, the head, and the fat, in order upon the
wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar: 1:9 But his inwards
and his legs shall he wash in water: and the priest shall burn all on
the altar, to be a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a
sweet savour unto the LORD.

1:10 And if his offering be of the flocks, namely, of the sheep, or of
the goats, for a burnt sacrifice; he shall bring it a male without
blemish.

1:11 And he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward before
the LORD: and the priests, Aaron's sons, shall sprinkle his blood
round about upon the altar.

1:12 And he shall cut it into his pieces, with his head and his fat:
and the priest shall lay them in order on the wood that is on the fire
which is upon the altar: 1:13 But he shall wash the inwards and the
legs with water: and the priest shall bring it all, and burn it upon
the altar: it is a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a

Zuckerberg kills his meat, himself.  That's a sign of higher being in my book 
-- he has a conscience that is very important to him.

I know what!  Kolberg stages of morality.  The lowest people worry about 
reward and punishment... higher ones, you can imagine.

Then, there are a lot of hipstirs with ideas.  I guess that's good.

I'm not really a liberal.  I don't like hipstirs who seek Buddism and Zen.

Apple people are not conservative, probably.

The First Book of the Kings

Commonly Called:

The Third Book of the Kings


1:1 Now king David was old and stricken in years; and they covered
him with clothes, but he gat no heat.

1:2 Wherefore his servants said unto him, Let there be sought for my
lord the king a young virgin: and let her stand before the king, and
let her cherish him, and let her lie in thy bosom, that my lord the
king may get heat.

1:3 So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the coasts of
Israel, and found Abishag a Shunammite, and brought her to the king.

heh.
