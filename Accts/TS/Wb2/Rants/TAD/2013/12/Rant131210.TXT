The Debug Distro will probably boot from anything, including USB sticks.  Turn
s out they are FAT32 raw images instead of ISO9660 ISO files.  It doesn't 
matter because a long, 64-bit mode operating system cannot use BIOS calls
once 
it's running and an operating system with no disk access is useless.

6:11 Seeing there be many things that increase vanity, what is man the
better?  6:12 For who knoweth what is good for man in this life, all
the days of his vain life which he spendeth as a shadow? for who can
tell a man what shall be after him under the sun?  7:1 A good name is
better than precious ointment; and the day of death than the day of
one's birth.

7:2 It is better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the
house of feasting: for that is the end of all men; and the living will
lay it to his heart.

7:3 Sorrow is better than laughter: for by the sadness of the
countenance the heart is made better.

7:4 The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart
of fools is in the house of mirth.

When I was taught to estimate assembly language instruction times, we counted 
the memory fetches for the instruction and memory fetches for the operation.  
I got to thinking about MMU's with paging and it takes 4-5 memory fetches to 
look up all the levels of paging for each access!  It doesn't take a genius
to 
figure-out no paging is faster!  (It's required for long mode, however.)

Today, I moved my compiler code out of low memory and it, now, executes 
faster.  My lowest 2 Meg range of memory has 4 level paging with 4K pages,
but 
upper memory has 3 level paging with 2 Gig pages.

I hate the concept of generating content ahead of time.  I hate multimedia.

I did sound for SimStructure, a Windows game.  Compared to the Commodore 64, 
sound in Windows is difficult, unless you just want to play a WAV file.  That 
pisses me off.

I want no multimedia, pregenerated content in my operating system.

I don't plan to support networking; I plan to always have it a special
purpose 
secondary operating system.  I wouldn't mind FTP if someone added it.  We are 
keeping the 100,000 LOC limit, however.

If you are not doing "multimedia", and are doing 640x480 16 color VGA, you 
will never run out of memory.  If you are doing "multimedia", you will 
immediately run out of memory.

Basically, I told you what my vision was -- a souped-up, 64-bit Commodore 64.

Yes, it has multitasking, but has no fancy algorithms for sharing the drive.  
If one task loads a 20 Meg file, nobody can use the drive until it's done.  
The target is video games and in a video game you don't typically have two 
tasks fighting over the drive, maybe just one.

I have thoroughly tested and proved that it works for what I intended.  Study 
what I have done and you will see what its good for.

On the feast of Stephen
When the snow lay round about
Deep and crisp and even
Brightly shone the moon that night
Though the frost was cruel
When a poor man came in sight
Gath'ring winter fuel

Hither, page, and stand by me
If thou know'st it, telling
Yonder peasant, who is he?
Where and what his dwelling?
Sire, he lives a good league hence
Underneath the mountain
Right against the forest fence
By Saint Agnes' fountain.

Bring me flesh and bring me wine
Bring me pine logs hither
Thou and I will see him dine
When we bear him thither.
Page and monarch forth they went
Forth they went together
Through the rude wind's wild lament
And the bitter weather

Sire, the night is darker now
And the wind blows stronger
Fails my heart, I know not how,
I can go no longer.
Mark my footsteps, my good page
Tread thou in them boldly
Thou shalt find the winter's rage
Freeze thy blood less coldly.

In his master's steps he trod
Where the snow lay dinted
Heat was in the very sod
Which the Saint had printed
Therefore, Christian men, be sure
Wealth or rank possessing
Ye who now will bless the poor
Shall yourselves find blessing

prepared ahead of time.  Then, you make Grub chain-load to that partition.

You can try using my bootloader to wedge itself in front of grub.  It has an

The Bible says to "sing a new song" about 7 times.  I like new songs.  I 
listen exclusively to talk radio because my station is hard to retune.  
therefore, I haven't heard any new music in 3 years.  Sometimes, I wonder if 
Rock music has been exhausted -- no newness.  Sometimes, I wonder if exodus 
from traditional BIG music sources to tiny ones has removed the gatekeepers 
and everybody is too stupid to know they're listening to crap.

I learned something while writing hymns and generating random songs.  I 
learned to distinguish good from bad music.  I used to listen to lots of
awful 
music.  Actually, it makes a difference if it is new to you.  I remember I 
really liked that Korn song when I first heard it.  Now, I don't know, but it

Jordan, that the LORD spake unto Joshua, saying, 4:2 Take you twelve
men out of the people, out of every tribe a man, 4:3 And command ye
them, saying, Take you hence out of the midst of Jordan, out of the
place where the priests' feet stood firm, twelve stones, and ye shall
carry them over with you, and leave them in the lodging place, where
ye shall lodge this night.

4:4 Then Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared of the
children of Israel, out of every tribe a man: 4:5 And Joshua said unto
them, Pass over before the ark of the LORD your God into the midst of
Jordan, and take you up every man of you a stone upon his shoulder,
according unto the number of the tribes of the children of Israel: 4:6
That this may be a sign among you, that when your children ask their
fathers in time to come, saying, What mean ye by these stones?  4:7
Then ye shall answer them, That the waters of Jordan were cut off
before the ark of the covenant of the LORD; when it passed over
Jordan, the waters of Jordan were cut off: and these stones shall be
