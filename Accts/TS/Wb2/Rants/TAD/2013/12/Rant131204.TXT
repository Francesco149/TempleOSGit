If you are overbearing on someone, perhaps, you break their spirit and they 
become husks, like sapped of life by a vampire.  I commented on the Pope

things cliched.

When Obama took-over in the financial crisis, it didn't seem like he did 
anything but painfully unoriginal and obvious, with the exception of saving a 
car company.  "I could have done that!" is what I thought.

and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their

the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.

13:18 Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number

the time that the house of God was in Shiloh.

19:1 And it came to pass in those days, when there was no king in
Israel, that there was a certain Levite sojourning on the side of
mount Ephraim, who took to him a concubine out of Bethlehemjudah.

19:2 And his concubine played the whore against him, and went away
from him unto her father's house to Bethlehemjudah, and was there four
whole months.

19:3 And her husband arose, and went after her, to speak friendly unto
her, and to bring her again, having his servant with him, and a couple
of asses: and she brought him into her father's house: and when the
father of the damsel saw him, he rejoiced to meet him.

19:4 And his father in law, the damsel's father, retained him; and he
abode with him three days: so they did eat and drink, and lodged
there.

that were with him, saying, Fight ye not with small or great, save
only with the king of Israel.

When I was 12, I babysat Kevin's kids.  I thought being a professional 
babysitter means you have to change them.  I changed Kim.  It was nothing -- 
just being a professional.

In 1990, I bought a camera for a trip to the northwest.  I took photos of 
Kevin's kids.  Ryan has his shirt off and Kim looks... slutty?  Dad really 
liked the pictures.  I tried to throw them away because I'm superstitious on 
anything from my past.  In 1996 I gave away everything, like Jesus said to be 
perfect.  Dad started grabbing shit to save.  I want to be perfect like Jesus 
said.  Dad is a pedophile and he figured he could use the Kim photos against 
me.  They're nothing.

Relax!  God is perfectly just.  Joseph in the Bible went to prison for false
