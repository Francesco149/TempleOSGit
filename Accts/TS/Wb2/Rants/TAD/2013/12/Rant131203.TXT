Nobody is losing anything.  TempleOS is a supplemental nonnetworked OS.  It
is 
fundamentally not a primary OS.



                                   Demands

When God is manifest to the World and He claims this operating system, 
publically, here's what I want:

1) VMware to again support PC Speaker and provide emulation if no PC Speaker 
is present.

2) Windows and Linux will support [C:/Doc/RedSea.TXT.Z,1] RedSea file system
so I can get rid of 2,000 
lines of redundant, blemished code -- FAT32 and ISO9660.  God's temple must
be 
perfect.
[C:/Kernel/Dsk/FileSysRedSea.CPP.Z,1]
[C:/Kernel/Dsk/FileSysFAT.CPP.Z,1]	:1004
[C:/Kernel/Dsk/FileSysISO1.CPP.Z,1]	:306
[C:/Adam/Boot/DskCDDVD.CPP.Z,1]	:536

3) Windows must burn ISO files to CD/DVD-ROMS.  USB memory sticks are not an 
option, so CD/DVD is what we use.

4) No secure boot.  TempleOS is a additional operating system that must be 
used along-side Windows or Linux.  It must dual boot.

5) Mandate to PC hardware manufacturers: ATA/ATAPI PIO must work.

6) PS2 emulated Keyboard and Mouse must work.  The BIOS must enable these.

7) VMware should allow ATAPI to connect real CD/DVD hardware.

8) Perhaps, VMware can enable faster than standard x86 IN/OUT instruction 
timing for ATA/ATAPI PIO, so the bandwidth isn't as bad.

9) VMware and others should list TempleOS as one of the official 64-bit 
operating systems.

10) Windows and Linux should support TempleOS .GRA graphics files.  These are 
just right-side-up .BMP files with 8-bit pixs 4-bits of color and 
transparency, with no palette.  Compression comes from the
[C:/Doc/RedSea.TXT.Z,1] RedSea .Z LZW 
compression.  (Let me know when you want it.)  [C:/Adam/Gr/GrDC.CPP.Z,284]
DCSave(), [C:/Adam/Gr/GrDC.CPP.Z,354] GRAWrite(), [C:/Adam/Gr/GrDC.CPP.Z,323]
DCLoad(), 
and [C:/Adam/Gr/GrDC.CPP.Z,365] GRARead().  [C:/Kernel/Compress.CPP.Z,1]




In other words, all hardware and BIOSes must support TempleOS as a native and 
as a virtual system, dual booted with Windows or Linux.

It would be neat if TempleOS were burned into BIOS ROMs.  My hope is that it 
will be finished and largely unchanging.  I need a good dictionary, first.  
Maybe, we leave the dictionary out.

I do not intend to ever support UEFI.  That monstrocity uses elf and various 
propriatary graphics formats.

I am not interested in networking.  

I forgot to put the 100000 line limit -- that's new.  I will add that.

Basically, I had a Commodore 64 when I was a teen.  I learned the insides of 
computing.  I had the satisfaction of being right on the hardware -- it was 
possible to understand how it worked.

Let's face it, a modern computer is 90% Internet stuff.  I am targeting the 
10%.

TempleOS is a place for offerings.  What was the Jewish temple used for?  It 
was a special place, a common shared place.

Your assignment is to draw an elephant as an offering for God as a 16 color 
BMP and as a 24-bit color high res elephant.  (You will learn why 16 color is 
better for offerings.)

God said conservatives were cowards.  Relax.  You have cowardly fears of 
drones and missiles and crime.  Is there a chance everything will be okay?  
What if God says so.  This is a separate issue but consider terrorism.  It's 
possible all the fear is a waste of time and no terrorism would actually 
exist.  I'm not commenting on terrorism, but God says to let the operating 
system be.

                               TempleOS Charter

TempleOS is God's official temple.  God said to use 640x480 16 color graphics 
and God said to have a single audio voice.  That is just like how He
specified 
cubits in the Bible!  He also said it must be perfect.  God needs a temple as 
a special beloved place where His people, young and old, can do offerings and 
consult God in the oracle.  Like Solomon's Temple, this is a focal point for 
the community.  Adults can write hymns, psalms (poems of praise) and 
meditation essays with good support for links to the Bible.  Like Cain and 
Abel, do offerings and learn what God likes and doesn't like.

* TempleOS will be limited to 100,000 lines of code, not including 
applications and demos.  This will ensure it stays out of trouble going a 
thousand years into the future.  It will not stray much from my vision as
long 
as this is kept.  Other, less important, characteristics can be changed but
as 
long as the 100,000 line limit is kept, it will stay true. 
 
* It must be kept perfect.  **Backward compatibility is NOT guaranteed.** 
You are 
safest working with JIT compilation instead of AOT binaries because members
to 
classes can be added and reorder, args with defaults can be added to existing 
functions, changes to #define values can be made, all without breaking 
compatibility.

* TempleOS is ring-0-only, running everything in kernel mode including 
applications.  You have full access to memory, I/O ports, instructions, etc. 
at all times, because that's fun.  It is simpler and faster, too.

* TempleOS will always identity-map memory in a single-address-map 
configuration.  (Virtual addresses are always kept equal to physical
addresses 
with a single map for all tasks on all cores.)  It's as though paging is not 
used.

* TempleOS will always be for one platform -- x86_64 PC compatibles.

* TempleOS will never have networking, so malware is less of an issue.

* TempleOS will always have one video mode, 640x480 by 16 colors, unless that 
mode becomes unavailable on computers in the future.

* TempleOS will always just have PC Speaker sound.

* TempleOS will always be free.  I might sell applications, support, or, 
possibly, do adware.

* TempleOS will always be 100% open source with all source included, unless 
device drivers or something can only be included with non-disclosure 
agreements.

* All function args and returns will be 64-bit.  No plans for C++.

* TempleOS documents are not for printing.  They're dynamic and intended for 
the screen.  There will always be just one font, a fixed-width font.  No 
Unicode, just "8-bit ASCII".

* TempleOS is not for multimedia.  Games will be created by programmers, not 
artists.  Sounds and images will be, primarily, calculated in real-time, not 
fetched.

* All functions, variables and class members will be accessible.  There are
no 
C++ public/private protections and all functions, even secondary ones in the 
kernel, can be called.

I like multicore, but single core speed is better, obviously.  Ironically,
I'm 
the only operating system that can use multicore in games.  Games are 
real-time.  SMP means the scheduler moves the tasks to a free CPU.  In a
game, 
you want to assign one task to each core and you certainly don't want the 
scheduler messing with it.  You need to know how many cores, so you can
update 
one strip of the screen.

I use 6 cores instead of 8 because I am in VMware.  When running my flight 
simulator, if VMware borrows a core for Windows stuff, suddenly... I assigned 
1/8th of the screen to each core and a single core gets borrowed...  That's
no 
good!  The screen update is put on hold because 1/8th of the screen has not 
been drawn!  Instead of 30 fps, I get 15 fps or worse and horrible glitches.

In SMP, they figure 7 cores one cycle and 1 core the next cycle is just the 
same as 8 cores.  When I am missing 1/8th of the screen being drawn and all 
put on hold, that is not acceptible.


Multicore is fun, when you have low level control -- let the kids play with 
it.  It's fairly difficult to get a net gain.  I don't use a GPU, so I can
put 
multicores to use on updating the screen, fairly easily.

I actually like not using GPU just for the transparency.  It makes multicore 
neat, too.

Mostly, vice is doing what you want and virtue is doing what you don't want.  
That's an over simplification.  Courage is a virtue.

Love and hate as concepts seem to cause absolute morality to arise.
