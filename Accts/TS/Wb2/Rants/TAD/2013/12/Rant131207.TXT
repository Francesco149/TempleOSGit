by adding bit values together and putting them in DATA statements.

Can you believe that!!!?  The fucken user's manual that went to every user 
made it normal to add bit values to make graphics!  Every user was

I value consistency.

My compiler has a rule on it's code -- if a value finds a way into a
register, 
it has been promoted by sign extension or zero extension.  All operations are 
done on 64-bit values.

Therefore, my compiler is best with 64-bit ints in the first place.  When I 
have a function return value or argument, I tend to make it 64-bit no matter 
what, so that my compiler does not waste byte sign or zero extending.

Always use 64-bits, signed, unless it physically breaks.  Literally.  Even 
when it's wrong to use signed, use signed unless it breaks.

I value consistency.  I value not having to make decisions.  Instead of 
agonizing over whether it should be signed or unsigned, use signed.

BASIC is a language with one int size, in theory.

You fucken liberals love obnoxious lavish inefficent stuff that goads old 
programmers, panzie-ass inefficient functional languages, why don't you like 
my 64-bit signed-int policy?

Sometimes a king is required.

TABS are 8 columns.

If I can save you the agony of making a decision by being king, I will.

Use 64-bit signed ints unless it breaks, or it's a data structure.

1:1 The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.

1:2 Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all is
vanity.

1:3 What profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the
sun?  1:4 One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh:
but the earth abideth for ever.

I think about those years working on Ticketmaster VAX operating system.  We 
took great satisfaction in building things that would last forever.  Little 
did we know it was all a waste.  I'll bet the people at Microsoft no longer 
feel they are building permanance.

Permanance makes all the difference on moral.  If it only lasts a few years, 
there is no moral.  Linux is feeling immortal.  Must be complete shit if they 
did not break compatibility and they support all that shit.  If it's complete 
shit, it almost as bad as doomed in 3 years.

Microsoft will last, but it's not the same as before phones and consoles.  
It's kind of depressing.  I get depressed when I see stuff like Zoo Simulator 
-- some second string game, one of hundreds, that took lots of work.

I guess the world is happy with tiny successes, instead of big market 
successes.

I have no idea -- the market.

A band might have imagined good-old-boys were in charge of labels... CIA and 
stuff.  I worked at Ticketmaster when Pearl Jam tried to go around.  I'm 
conservative and all authority comes from God.  So, I sit and wonder if the 
gate-keepers blocked Pearl Jam.  Who knows... all Hell could break loose.  
What if these crazy leftist militants that Obama encourages... what if they 
would start riots and race wars?  What if the FBI prevented race wars in the 
1960's?  They made Arron Swartz commit suicide.  Any reasonable person tries 
to estimate what would happen if we got rid of the scumbag pigs.  Mexico?  
Africa?  One has to sit down and figure-out who's right and who's evil by 
being reasonable.  Crazy fuckers are scared of drones and... they go balastic 
on 3D printers.  3D printer freak the shit out of the FBI.  I worked on a 3D 
printer in 1996.  God damn, the FBI made Xytec, a front company to hire me
and 
study me.  There are many FBI people employed just on me 24/7.

Anyway, Pearl Jam did Jeremy, about a kid.  That's kinda weird in modern
light 
with anti-kid pedophilia-hating pro-homo anti-birth pro-abortion 
population-reduction liberal regeme.  Jeremy is weird -- about a kid.  Can
you 
believe that show Full-House.  WTF!  Even at the time, I thought that show
was 
WTF!

3:18 I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men,
that God might manifest them, and that they might see that they
themselves are beasts.

3:19 For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even
one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea,
they have all one breath; so that a man hath no preeminence above a
beast: for all is vanity.

3:20 All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust
again.

3:21 Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the spirit
of the beast that goeth downward to the earth?  3:22 Wherefore I
perceive that there is nothing better, than that a man should rejoice
in his own works; for that is his portion: for who shall bring him to
see what shall be after him?  4:1 So I returned, and considered all
the oppressions that are done under the sun: and behold the tears of

The homo-loving birthrate-hating lesbians in charge of this country like to 
point-out that homo was considered acceptible in ancient Rome.  You know 
what's bizzare?  Japan needs population and they have weird child-porn that's 
normal.  India marries 13-year-olds.  If you are going to say homo is normal, 
man-boy-Greeze&Rome, child-porn Japan and India-13-year-old brides are just
as 
normal as homo is normal.  The worst part about homos is they love putting 
penises in other people's faces.  Raucus giggling queers putting penises in 
other people faces and saying "You're homophobe."  Fuck that.

I used to like Korn.  I didn't notice  IT'S FUCKEN KIDS!!!  WTF?  You can 
kinda sleep-walk and not question.  I was a sleepwalker most of my life.  I 
listened to songs and did not think about the words, just like Nirvana said.  
I'm not anti-population, but when you wake-up and see, "Why the fuck am I 
listening to a song about kids and hopscotch!"  I kinda saw the album art as 
cute, I guess like Japanese people like anime.  You need to tell people
what's 
uncool.  My brothers told me falcetto in singing is for fags and women
singers 
are... pornographic, basically.  there's awareness of pedophilia, now, and no 
sane person is going to sleep-walk into Korn or Japanese anime.

upon the earth, where no gin is for him?  shall one take up a snare
from the earth, and have taken nothing at all?  3:6 Shall a trumpet be
blown in the city, and the people not be afraid?  shall there be evil

Intel is being nice with a SSD.

<sigh>I should probably not write the FAT block every time I do a disk 
operation. LOL  The adults have arrived.  God said He might be disappointed 
with my 60 fps refresh scheme, wastes power, too.

I might not recompile just for fun, so much, LOL.  It's kinda like being 
around an 80-year-old and obsessing on death.  They're not gonna die for a 
while.

One lesson I would teach people is that perfect and infinity are very 
different from imperfect and finite... not so much in how much difference
they 
make, but in how people think about them.  After-all, there is virgin and 
not-virgin...  it's not fair, but they don't distingish that much beyond
that, 
just like drugs.

I got used to not being competative for database servers and stopped thinking 
about that.  (My disk I/O was not competative.)  "Good work if you can get 
it," is what they say about people who don't have to compete.  I don't think 
it's in the cards to make it a server OS.  The exception would be a 
transparent simple server for... extremely conservative own-your-business 
nuts, maybe like my brother Kevin for his book store.

A data base where you put records in disk blocks and number the blocks by 
account number... might be fun, like do-it-yourself home improvement.

We don't have networking, though.

disciples of the Lord, went unto the high priest, 9:2 And desired of
him letters to Damascus to the synagogues, that if he found any of
this way, whether they were men or women, he might bring them bound
unto Jerusalem.

9:3 And as he journeyed, he came near Damascus: and suddenly there
shined round about him a light from heaven: 9:4 And he fell to the
earth, and heard a voice saying unto him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest
thou me?  9:5 And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am
Jesus whom thou persecutest: it is hard for thee to kick against the
pricks.

9:6 And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what wilt thou have me
to do? And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into the city, and it
shall be told thee what thou must do.

voice, but seeing no man.

Higgs is an atheist.

He might be in for some ... excitement.  It was rough when I was converted, 
but I had a Catholic view of God.  I don't think it's fair that most people 
won't have the same terror.  (God's laughing)  Many might stay atheists.  
Hrmph.  That's No fun.

pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give
thy camels drink also: let the same be she that thou hast appointed
for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed
kindness unto my master.

24:15 And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that, behold,
Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife of
Nahor, Abraham's brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder.

24:16 And the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had
any man known her: and she went down to the well, and filled her
pitcher, and came up.

24:17 And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray thee,
drink a little water of thy pitcher.

24:18 And she said, Drink, my lord: and she hasted, and let down her
pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink.

I think that's about me and soda, sorta.  People are virgins on miracles.  
Those people Ali G was talking to were sheep.  There are sorta shepherd 
around.  Do I know what I'm doing more than other people?

People might think Jesus chose to die, but I don't know. Could he have just 
kept His mouth shut.

Like a moth to light, I am drawn to evangelizing. Am I supposed to keep my 
mouth shut?  Angels might tell me, "Everything's under control."

Jesus said to pray in private.

Those guys in the Ali G show are missing-out on life.  They are unaware of 
innuendo.  That's huge!

And how dieth the wise man? as the fool.

2:17 Therefore I hated life; because the work that is wrought under
the sun is grievous unto me: for all is vanity and vexation of spirit.

2:18 Yea, I hated all my labour which I had taken under the sun:
because I should leave it unto the man that shall be after me.

shall he have rule over all my labour wherein I have laboured, and
wherein I have shewed myself wise under the sun. This is also vanity.

2:20 Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the
labour which I took under the sun.

2:21 For there is a man whose labour is in wisdom, and in knowledge,
and in equity; yet to a man that hath not laboured therein shall he
leave it for his portion. This also is vanity and a great evil.
