Back in 1992, I did a scheduler for a 8-bit microcontroller for a class.  We 
made a linked list of tasks sorted by when they are ready to run.  Then, set 
the timer to interrupt based on the time of the head of the linked list.

If you want that, use Linux.

My highest goal is simplicity, not efficiency.  My company is "Trivial 
Solutions".  My highest goal is low line count and conceptual simplicity.

I have one set of task pointers that go in a circle ordered by
WINDOW_Z_STACK. 
 I do not want another set of pointers for ready-to-run.  I keep my timer at
a 
fixed 1kHz interval and I go in a circle around the tasks and quickly skip 
unready tasks by checking their wake-up time.  I skip them if they are
waiting 
on a message.

When you send a message to a task waiting on a message, you just clear the
bit 
saying "waiting on a message" and it runs the next time it is checked.

thee, and as he hath sworn unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and
to Jacob.

Each core saves 1,000 contexts and restores 1,000 contexts every second when

Therefore, when idle, each core is burning 0.25mS of time per second.

Compitabilty is the number one, in fact, only concern that an OS must deal 
with.

Interrupts are an incompatibility source.  I'm more than happy to pay a 
performance penalty polling hard disk and CDROM, to avoid incompatibility 
problems.  It makes the code simpler, too.

I am not doing PCI devices, not doing USB.

I wrote a 64-bit x86_64 compiler and an assembler and unassembler.

I wrote full support for making ISO files.  I have a CDROM bootloader.

I have a Hard Disk boot loader.  Boot the ISO file to install onto harddrive.

Mine works with BIOS, not UEFI.  Not going to do UEFI.

Mine supports ATA/ATAPI PIO.

Mine supports 640x480 16 color VGA.

Mine supports PS/2 keyboard/mouse in USB legacy mode.

I am not doing networking.  Mine is intended to dual boot and be used for fun 
stuff, as God's temple.

I plan to make demands to make hardware companies support me.

                                   Demands

When God is manifest to the World and He claims this operating system, 
publically, here's what I want:

* VMware to again support PC Speaker and provide emulation if no PC Speaker
is 
present.

* Windows and Linux will support [C:/Doc/RedSea.TXT.Z,1] RedSea file system
so I can get rid of 2,000 
lines of redundant, blemished code -- FAT32 and ISO9660.  God's temple must
be 
perfect.
[C:/Kernel/Dsk/FileSysRedSea.CPP.Z,1]
[C:/Kernel/Dsk/FileSysFAT.CPP.Z,1]	:1004
[C:/Kernel/Dsk/FileSysISO1.CPP.Z,1]	:306
[C:/Adam/Boot/DskCDDVD.CPP.Z,1]	:536

* No secure boot.  TempleOS is a additional operating system that must be
used 
along-side Windows or Linux.  It must dual boot.

* Mandate to PC hardware manufacturers: ATA/ATAPI PIO must work.

* PS2 emulated Keyboard and Mouse must work.  The BIOS must enable these.

* VMware should allow ATAPI to connect real CD/DVD hardware.

* Perhaps, VMware can enable faster than standard x86 IN/OUT instruction 
timing for ATA/ATAPI PIO, so the bandwidth isn't as bad.

* VMware and others should list TempleOS as one of the official 64-bit 
operating systems.

* Windows and Linux should support TempleOS .GRA graphics files.  These are 
just right-side-up .BMP files with 8-bit pixs 4-bits of color and 
transparency, with no palette.  Compression comes from the
[C:/Doc/RedSea.TXT.Z,1] RedSea .Z LZW 
compression.  (Let me know when you want it.)  [C:/Adam/Gr/GrDC.CPP.Z,284]
DCSave(), [C:/Adam/Gr/GrDC.CPP.Z,354] GRAWrite(), [C:/Adam/Gr/GrDC.CPP.Z,323]
DCLoad(), 
and [C:/Adam/Gr/GrDC.CPP.Z,365] GRARead().  [C:/Kernel/Compress.CPP.Z,1]




In other words, all hardware and BIOSes must support TempleOS as a native and 
as a virtual system, dual booted with Windows or Linux.

It would be neat if TempleOS were burned into BIOS ROMs.  My hope is that it 
will be finished and largely unchanging.  I need a good dictionary, first.  
Maybe, we leave the dictionary out.

I do not intend to ever support UEFI.  That monstrocity uses elf and various 
propriatary graphics formats.

If you write a BIOS bootloader, it's really easy.  It starts in real-mode and 
you just call INT 10h before you change to long mode.  Piece of cake.  I also
