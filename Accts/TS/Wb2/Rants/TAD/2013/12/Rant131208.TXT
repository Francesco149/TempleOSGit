I did not like this.  It disturbed me:
Article about Howard Stern

It seemed like a ritual sacrifice.  I watched up until Tina Fey said she 
didn't have sex until her husband and was fat.  Now, that I think about it... 
Tina Fey made fun of Sarah Palin.

I got brutalized by some demon -- CIA tortured Aaron Swartz until death.  
Guess what?  I'm here to torture CIA.  Say hello to Mr. God, you shitz!

Justice is right.  Justice is done.

I had praise for street smarts.  Howard Stern is a fucken demon -- too street 
smart.  He seems like a pathetic pervert who needs full nude because more 
innocent do much for him.

26:38 And ye shall perish among the heathen, and the land of your

26:39 And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity
in your enemies' lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers
shall they pine away with them.

26:40 If they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their
fathers, with their trespass which they trespassed against me, and
that also they have walked contrary unto me; 26:41 And that I also
have walked contrary unto them, and have brought them into the land of
their enemies; if then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled, and they
then accept of the punishment of their iniquity: 26:42 Then will I
remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaac, and
also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the
land.

Yeah, it's a bitch confessing and being humble.  Some demons think it is
their 
job to judge.  Fuck the CIA.  Howard Stern reminds me of a demon in Hell
who's 
job is torturing the lost souls.  I have felt a certain connection to him.  
Maybe, he's a decent guy with a bad job.

I listened to Howard Stern a little, about ten years ago.  Sometimes, it 
seemed like we had a connection and friendship.  It can't be good, what he 
does, can it?  Is it my fault?  I guess Tina Fey needed justice done to her.

Mark Zuckerberg seems like a friend, a little brother.  I form these 
connections and pretty soon I'm in the awkward position... Did I cause this?  
Shist.  It's not always bad, exactly.

mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This is a grievous mourning
to the Egyptians: wherefore the name of it was called Abelmizraim,
which is beyond Jordan.

For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in
the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the
field for a possession of a buryingplace of Ephron the Hittite, before
Mamre.

that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his
father.

50:15 And when Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead, they
said, Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will certainly requite us
all the evil which we did unto him.

1991, during Iraq War I.  He named the team, "Marmie's Army".  He changed the 
player position names.  "Tackle" became  "patriot" after the patriot missile, 
etc.  LOL

The reference of Marmy's Army was about getting a little too full of yourself 
as a leader with a cult of personality or something.

"peradventure" is relevant.

I worked at a company, Graphic Technologies.  I programmed chips to put on 
printer cartridges so they could be refilled.  (The printer company wanted to 
sell more cartridges, so they put chips that expired and prevented
refilling.) 
 To make the chips work, the chips needed to say, "Copyright Xerox", in ASCII 
in the chips.

Xerox thought the legal system was fools.  They thought saying "Copyright 
Xerox" was a clever way of making so no one could refill their cartridges. 
It 
went to the Supreme Court with Lexmark vs Static Control.  In that case, 
Lexmark sold cheap cartridges if you promised not to refill them.  Lexmark 
lost in the Supreme Court.

148:11 Kings of the earth, and all people; princes, and all judges of
the earth:

148:12 Both young men, and maidens; old men, and children:

148:13 Let them praise the name of the LORD: for his name alone is
excellent; his glory is above the earth and heaven.

148:14 He also exalteth the horn of his people, the praise of all his
saints; even of the children of Israel, a people near unto him. Praise
ye the LORD.



149:1 Praise ye the LORD. Sing unto the LORD a new song, and his
praise in the congregation of saints.

149:2 Let Israel rejoice in him that made him: let the children of
Zion be joyful in their King.

4:7 And when they had set them in the midst, they asked, By what
power, or by what name, have ye done this?  4:8 Then Peter, filled
with the Holy Ghost, said unto them, Ye rulers of the people, and
elders of Israel, 4:9 If we this day be examined of the good deed done
to the impotent man, by what means he is made whole; 4:10 Be it known
unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of
Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the
dead, even by him doth this man stand here before you whole.

4:11 This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which
is become the head of the corner.

4:12 Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other
name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.

4:13 Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived
that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and they
took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus.

PDEs are about vibrating drum head, cross patterns and boundary conditions

8:34 Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather,
that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also
maketh intercession for us.

8:35 Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation,
or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or
sword?  8:36 As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day
long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.

8:37 Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him
that loved us.

8:38 For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor
principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,
8:39 Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to
separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.

9:1 I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing
me witness in the Holy Ghost, 9:2 That I have great heaviness and

Inseparable.  :-)

tabernacle of the congregation, and wash them with water.

40:13 And thou shalt put upon Aaron the holy garments, and anoint him,
and sanctify him; that he may minister unto me in the priest's office.

40:14 And thou shalt bring his sons, and clothe them with coats: 40:15
And thou shalt anoint them, as thou didst anoint their father, that
they may minister unto me in the priest's office: for their anointing
shall surely be an everlasting priesthood throughout their
generations.

40:16 Thus did Moses: according to all that the LORD commanded him, so
did he.

40:17 And it came to pass in the first month in the second year, on
the first day of the month, that the tabernacle was reared up.

40:18 And Moses reared up the tabernacle, and fastened his sockets,
and set up the boards thereof, and put in the bars thereof, and reared
up his pillars.
