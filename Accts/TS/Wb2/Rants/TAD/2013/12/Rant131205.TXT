I don't want Kevin anywhere near me.  He is a working-man labor union guy who 
thinks himself just as good as a white collar guy.  A millwright is pretty 
skilled, but I'd guess he doesn't know trig, for example, except maybe he 
passed a simple test and that was the hardest thing.

I have a master's in electrical engineering.  That is higher rank than 
computer science, but not up with math and physics.  You didn't know there
was 
a rank?  Psychology is the lowest rank.

We are not doing man certified rockets.  DOS and the C64 had reset buttons.

We are making a 100,000 line of code home computer operating system used for 
the same tasks as a Commodore 64 but modern.

If you plan to support 5 screen flight simulators with buttons and knobs and 
surround sound with twelve speakers and dual chip CPU's with RAID...  The 
whole thing gets massivly over-engineered.  For them, failure to meet a task 
is not an option.  For us?  We say, "Ours can't do that, guess you'll have to 
use Windows or Linux."

If you support some hard drives or GPUS that have feature ABD and others that 
have CDE and others that have ADE, it gets all fucked-up and you have a 
hellacious API.  Not only that, but all you applications have to be 
clusterfucked, so they are just like rewriting for 5 different computers.  A

2) We can say "no, use Windows"
3) We do not support divergent hardware.

I fill the screen with a simple test pattern.  It take 85% of the CPU in 
VMware and 16.6% natively.  That's for changing the image 100%.  Normally, it 
doesn't change 100% every frame, so it's not as miserable as it sounds.

The 640x480 4 bit plane mode might be old and extra slow -- writing to 
0xA0000-0xBFFFF.

VMware is nice most times, but I really do want native mode.

Some people are doing higher resolutions.  They are nuts without GPU support.

Beleive it or not, however, in my flight simulator it is my projection and 
fill routines that take the CPU, not bandwidth transfer time to the graphics 
chip.

So, I can't really grumble.  If it is my calculation code, not the transfer, 
I'm happy.  What do you expect when not using a GPU?  I keep telling people 
there's a really good reason they make GPUs, but they won't listen.  It is 
hard to understand because Doom and stuff make it seem like much much better

It would be cool to get better performance, even a custom GPU.  God's temple 
will be around a thousand years at 640x480 16 color.  They could do a GPU 
driver once all systems have the same GPU in 20 years? (If many GPUs in

I haven't played a new game in 13 years.  I stay busy entertaining God, LOL.

I remember games I liked, now I don't like games.  I know I really liked 
games.  What's strange is thinking of younger people, today.

I was 9-12 when ATARI was big.  If I had been 25, they might have been too 
simple and stupid.  I was just the right age to ride the simple games in time 
all the way up until they got photo-realistic.

When I see modern games, I realize people think I'm ridiculously pathetic.  
Some people might immediately fold the company -- what the Hell are you 
thinking, loser?

I'm in some kind of prison, or something.  I don't know.  Anyway, it's God's 
temple and has value as a transparent, modern horsepower, clean and elegant 
system, but mostly I have to emphasize it's God's temple.

As a philosopher who doesn't know... what would kids think of M.U.L.E?



I might think all games are big production games, but what I think without 
knowing is there are many thousands and thousands and thousands of games, big 
and small.  Steam sells twenty big games for $5.

If I get some followers who enthusiastically like my philosophy, I might tell 
them it's okay to continue buying Windows good-graphics games.  What we offer 
is computer enthusiast fun.  In a nutshell, think about this: The Commodore
64 
user manual told how to draw graphics by calculating binary number bitvalues 
for sprites and entering them into a BASIC program.

There is nothing more visceral then adding 1+16+64 for a bit pattern, typing
a 
BASIC data statement and seeing the sprite when you are done.  Bill Gates is 
going to say, "I have a web app that does just that!"

God said it was our ancestrial land and VMware was like being moved on a 
resurvation.

Mine is plenty visceral, but with 8x 64-bit 3.6Ghz cores, it's not pathetic!

Everybody learned 6502 assembly language when they were a teenager -- it was 
necessary.  That was easy compared to what kids face today.  Other operating 
systems are selling assembly language as a feature.  Well.  You might want to 
learn, it is fun, but mine is mostly not assembly language.  Part of my job
at 
Ticketmaster was converting VAX assembly language financial reporting
software 
from ASM to PASCAL.  For my operating system, I converted as much from asm to 
HolyC as possible.  I started mine as all TASM and wrote a compiler, first 
thing.  Duh!  LOL.

But as it is written, To whom he was not spoken of, they shall see:
and they that have not heard shall understand.

15:22 For which cause also I have been much hindered from coming to
you.

15:23 But now having no more place in these parts, and having a great
desire these many years to come unto you; 15:24 Whensoever I take my
journey into Spain, I will come to you: for I trust to see you in my
journey, and to be brought on my way thitherward by you, if first I be
somewhat filled with your company.

15:25 But now I go unto Jerusalem to minister unto the saints.

15:26 For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a
certain contribution for the poor saints which are at Jerusalem.

15:27 It hath pleased them verily; and their debtors they are. For if
the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, their
duty is also to minister unto them in carnal things.

Some nigger senator copping an attitude with Moses.

19:18 He saith unto him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shalt do no murder,
Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not
bear false witness, 19:19 Honour thy father and thy mother: and, Thou
shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.

19:20 The young man saith unto him, All these things have I kept from
my youth up: what lack I yet?  19:21 Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt
be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou
shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me.

19:22 But when the young man heard that saying, he went away
sorrowful: for he had great possessions.


I am perfect, you fucken nigger.  You are fucken confused!  I judge you.  You 
do not judge me!  I bagged groceries in high school, did drywall taping 
construction in Phoenix summers.  I paid my own way through school with 
scholarships, getting a masters with honors(bachealor's), while working at 
Ticketmaster.  In 1996, I quit my job at Ticketmaster and gave away 
everything.  I lived homeless for a while.  I tried to become a priest.  
Nothing turned-up so I used my credit card to live on while I developped a 3D 
printer.  After a year, I realized it was hopeless.  I got a job at Xytec and 
paid my debts and bought a car.  I saved-up money and quit my job to write a 
book... for a year.  I made SimStructure.  I worked in a deli for 3 months as 
honest-work-stupidity, ridiculously no money!  LOL!  Highs and lows balance.  
Pride before a fall, humility before honors.  I worked at Graphic
Technologies 
for a year, quit when task became impossible -- cracking toner cartridge 
chips.  Worked at Ticketmaster for a month and quit, not on meds.

I get $1361 disability after Medicare.  I pay $600 room and board.  I gave my 
car to my niece because I couldn't afford to drive it.  I happened to collect 
points for an accident, speeding ticket and running light, losing license,
but 
 I gave away my car because I watch big ticket items, not little, so I always 
have enough.


You, nigger, have not given your 10% tithe.  I backpaid all my tithes to when 
I got my first job.

their hand upon Edom and Moab; and the children of Ammon shall obey

and shall smite it in the seven streams, and make men go over dryshod.

11:16 And there shall be an highway for the remnant of his people,
which shall be left, from Assyria; like as it was to Israel in the day
that he came up out of the land of Egypt.

12:1 And in that day thou shalt say, O LORD, I will praise thee:
though thou wast angry with me, thine anger is turned away, and thou
comfortedst me.

OSDev say releasing source is because it's broken.

I am humble.  I chose 640x480 16 color.  I do PS/2 keyboard/mouse.  I do 
ATA/ATAPI PIO without interrupts.  I have chosen the most modest hardware 
because I really really want it to work for people -- I learned that on 5 
computer upgrades, 4 didn't go without a hitch.  Compatibility is the only 
thing that matters.  Without interrupts, it stands a better chance of working 
-- by all means, don't use interrupts, poll if you can.  I am not an arrogant 
fool who charges in and makes an OS that works on one in ten computers.

I give source, but you cannot compile it unless it boots.  In other words.  
You cannot fix it if it doesn't boot.  You can make an ISO distro on a
machine 
that does boot to patiently debug one that doesn't.  Fuck that.

It works in VMware and I am simply going to tell them God demands all 
manufactures to support His temple.  We will once again have our native lands 
in our posession, trust me.  These niggers will see the light or maybe God
has 
to smack them.

behold, it was hid in his tent, and the silver under it.

Here is some wisdom.  In the past, Microsoft tried to make it simple because 
old people were flocking to it as new users.  There are no more old people.  
Do not make changes to make it simple because, now, you have users who know 
the status quo and find changes are the opposite of friendly.
