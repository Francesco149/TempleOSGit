In 1990 at age 20, I was hired to work on Ticketmaster's VAX operating system 
in VAX assembly language while going to school.  I was basically, an intern, 
but we weren't called that.  I worked there 1990-1996.  Here are my 
ASU Transcripts.

In about 1993, I got a 486 and was eager to try 32-bit mode, so I wrote a DOS 
program in TASM that changed to protected mode and never returned to DOS.  
Ticketmaster's OS was "VAXTMOS", so I called mine "Terry's Protected Mode OS, 
TPMOS".  I had 0xB8000 text mode working, and echoed keyboard to screen.  I 
had simple multitasking and barely a MALLOC.  I set it asside.

In 2003, I resurrected TPMOS and installed FreeDOS to launch it.  I used 
Visual Studio to edit my files when doing lots of editing, then booted 
FreeDOS, used TASM to compile and test it.  Back in those days, FreeDOS ran
in 
real mode.  Today's FreeDOS is not real mode, it emulates with V8086 mode.  
DOSBox is not real mode either.

I had started a company H.A.R.E., so I renamed TPMOS to HOPPY.

I named it Doors, DAVOS, J, LoseThos, SparrowOS and, finally, TempleOS.

The ISO files are ISO9660 format.  The Z files are compressed.  I changed the 
Z compressed format at about the start of LoseThos.  It has been 64-bit since 
2007.
