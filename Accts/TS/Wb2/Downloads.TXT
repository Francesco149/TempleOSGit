This is the Trivial Solution internal company distro.  Only run this on a 
virtual machine, not bare metal hardware because it's settings could cause 
problems.  The hard drive must be partitioned.  Install Std Distro, then 
install this on top.

Download TempleOS V2.03 - Debug Distro (0.0 MB)
This is a debug distro.  The CDROM bootloader uses BIOS INT 0x13 0x42 to load 
Kernel.BIN.C which has been modified to also hold a small RAM drive (Drive A) 
that fits in the low 640k.  The bootloader starts in real mode and the kernel 
changes to long, 64-bit mode.  It loads the 64-bit compiler and assembler, 
compiles some, but not all, of the normal start-up scripts and drops you off 
at the [C:/Kernel/Dbg1a.CPP.Z,650] Dbg command-line where you can JIT
compile, use [C:/Kernel/EdLite.CPP.Z,59] EdLite on RAM files, 
and use many of the other normal Kernel commands.  I could not fit all the 
normal start-up scripts into the small RAM drive, so you do not have the 
window manager or normal document framework.  You should have many Gig of RAM 
to play with with RAM Drive B, a high memory RAM drive, but you have only 
those few files.  When I generate this distro, I call
[C:/Demo/AcctExample/TSDistro.CPP.Z,1] MakeBootDrvFile.
