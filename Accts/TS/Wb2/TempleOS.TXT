                         The Temple Operating System


(* Has a 64-Bit AOT/JIT compiler, not interpreter.)


TempleOS is an x86_64, multi-tasking, multi-cored, public domain, open
source, 
ring-0-only, single-address-map (identity-mapped), non-networked, PC
operating 
system for recreational programming.  It sticks to common, 64-bit hardware 
instead of distinct drivers because you must shoot-the-moon.  Also,
redundancy 
and varied capabilities are unpleasant compared to 
everybody-has-the-same-thing.

Normally, "failure is not an option" applies.  Since TempleOS accompanies 
Windows or Linux, however, failure is an option.  There is no reason to 
duplicate all use cases -- browsing, multimedia, desktop publishing, etc.  
Instead, it's simple, fun, and beautiful.  I capped the lines of code at 
100,000, so it will never be an ugly monstrocity.  Currently, it is .  Since 
God's temple must be perfect and we have 1,000 years in mind, I do not
promise 
that anything is future-proof.

The main reason TempleOS is simple and beautiful is because it's ring-0-only 
and identity-mapped.  Linux wants to be a secure, multi-user mainframe.  
That's the vision for Linux.  That's why it has file permissions.  The vision 
for TempleOS is a modern, 64-bit Commodore 64.  The C64 was a home computer 
mostly used for games.  It trained my generation how to program.  It was 
simple, open and hackable.  It was not networked.  The games were not 
multimedia works of art, but generated programmatically with innocent, 
programmer (non-artist) quality graphics.  It was simple and unsecure.  If
you 
don't have malware and you don't have bugs, protection just slows things down 
and makes the code complicated.

A troll might ask, "Why not just use DOS?  It was ring-0-only and 
single-address-map."  Actually, they wouldn't because many people would say, 
"Cool idea!  I'm gonna dust-off DOS right now and have some fun!"  DOS is 
16-bit with segmentation, though, which is awful.  TempleOS is 64-bit, flat, 
non-segmented and multi-cored.  It's like a modern, souped-up, multi-tasking, 
cross between DOS and a Commodore 64.  It has a C64-like shell with
[C:/Doc/HolyC.TXT,1] HolyC, a 
dialect of C/C++, instead of BASIC.  It was written from scratch, and not
even 
ASCII was sacred -- it has 8-bit unsigned character source code to support 
European languages.  Also, the source code has graphics.

A troll might say, "But, it can crash!"  We all used DOS for years and loved 
it. Computers even had a reset switch!  Just think of the power of ring-0, 
muhahaha! Think of the speed and simplicity of ring-0-only and 
identity-mapping.  It's only [C:/Accts/TS/Wb2/LineCnt.TXT,1] 129,664 lines of
code, including the compiler and 
can change tasks in half a microsecond because it doesn't mess with page 
tables or privilege levels.  Inter-process communication is effortless
because 
every task can access every other task's memory.

It's fun having access to everything.  When I was a teenager, I had a book, 
Mapping the Commodore 64, that told what every location in memory did.  I 
liked copying the ROM to RAM and poking around at the ROM BASIC's variables.  
Everybody directly poked the hardware ports.

TempleOS is simpler than Linux and you can have hours of fun tinkering
because 
all memory and ports are accessible.  Memory is identity-mapped at all times, 
so you can modify any task's memory from any other task.  You can access all 
disk blocks, too.  I had a blast using a C64 disk block editor to modify 
directories to un-delete files, when I was a kid.  Maybe, you want to play 
with a raw-block database, or make your own file system?

I wrote all [C:/Accts/TS/Wb2/LineCnt.TXT,1] 129,664 lines of TempleOS over
the last 15.5 years, full-time, 
including the 64-bit compiler.  It was called, at various times, "Hoppy", "
The J Operating System", "LoseThos" and "SparrowOS".  Here are my 
college transcripts.  I've been a professional operating system developer 
since 1990 when I was hired to work on Ticketmaster's VAX OS.
