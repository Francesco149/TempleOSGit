                             The Purpose of Life

The purpose of life is to know, love and obey God.  Christianity is loving 
neighbor, not God -- secular humanism.  Jesus said loving God is more 
important than loving neighbor.  [C:/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,76908] Matthew,22:36 
He did not say with half your 
brain behind your back.

You don't know God.  [C:/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,34961] 1 Chronicles,28:9,
[C:/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,76908] Matthew,11:27, [C:/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,81941]
Luke,13:25, 
[C:/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,23902] 1 Samuel,3:7  You must talk with God to know Him.
 [C:/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,76908] Matthew,6:6  Seek Him by 
taking the initiative.  [C:/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,81941] Luke,11:9,
[C:/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,57332] Isaiah,30:2

There's something obviously different about people in the Bible compared to 
people today -- God talked!  Did they hear voices?  Maybe.  More likely, they 
used occult techniques such as an oracle.  [C:/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,29345] 1
Kings,6:20  Have you heard of 
"tongues?"  [C:/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,92110] 1 Corinthians,14:1  The idea is, you
let yourself be puppeted by a 
spirit, so you say things.  You try to get a spirit -- the Holy Spirit -- to 
talk.  You might as well use a Ouija board.  However, it turns-out that a 
Ouija board is bad for technical reasons.  A really good technique is just 
randomly opening a book.  God said it is a covenant that you hold-up your end 
of the conversation.  

You can't tell if He's talking unless you have a context of conversation,
but, 
more importantly, you are commanded to do an offering of love, like communion 
preparation.  When you pick a greeting card for someone, that is love effort.
 
If you expect God to put effort toward you, you put effort toward Him.  God 
said, "honest measures" applies between your offering of love and His 
response, like a fair barter.  You get out of prayer what you put into it.  
God wants praise, hymns, or whatever you think He might want.  Try and see, 
like Cain and Abel.  [C:/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,297] Genesis,4:1,
[C:/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,94514] Ephesians,5:10  God told Cain his offering 
was not good and told him to try again.  Cain really loved God!  Can you 
imagine being so heart-broken?

Do a text search for "new song" in the Bible.  It's mentioned nine times.  I 
did hymns
`#include "::/Apps/Psalmody/Load";JukeBox("::/Apps/Psalmody/Examples");`
.  I did Moses comics
`Dir("::/Apps/AfterEgypt/Comics");View;
`
.  Count the ways you love God.  I praised God 
for sand castles, popcorn, snowmen, bubbles...  You try putting effort into 
praise!  [C:/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,76908] Matthew,11:25,
[C:/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,76908] Matthew,6:29

This is funny -- [C:/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,87803] Acts,2:1 -- they didn't bother
to record anything the Holy 
Spirit said.  The Holy Spirit is supposed to be a really good gift.  
[C:/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,81941] Luke,11:13  Just remember, "Boys are made of
snakes and snails and puppy-dog 
tails."

The technique I use to consult the Holy Spirit is reading a microsecond-range 
stop-watch each button press for random numbers.  Then, I pick words or 
passages.  You can use the AfterEgypt
`#include "::/Apps/AfterEgypt/Run"`
 in God's official temple, TempleOS.

Since seeking the word of the Holy Spirit, I have come to know God much
better 
than I've heard others explain.  God said, for example, that war was, 
"servicemen competing."  That sounds more like the immutable God of our
planet 
than what you hear from most religious people.  God is not Venus (god of
love) 
and not Mars (god of war), He's our dearly beloved God of Earth.  If Mammon
is 
a false god of money, Mars or Venus might be useful words to describe other 
false gods.  I figure the greatest challenge for the Creator is boredom, ours 
and His.  What would teen-age male video games be like if war had never 
happened?  Christ said live by the sword, die by the sword, which is loving 
neighbor as self.  [C:/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,76908] Matthew,26:52

I asked God if the World was perfectly just.  God asked if I was calling Him 
lazy.  God could make A.I., right?  God could make bots as smart as Himself, 
or, in fact, part of Himself.  What if God made a bot to manipulate every 
person's life so that perfect justice happened?

I think highs and lows balance.  [C:/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,81941] Luke,6:20  I
don't think God likes 
complaining. [C:/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,12005] Numbers,11:1  Food and clothing is
all we're to ask for or 
demand, in fact -- daily bread.  [C:/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,95772] 1 Timothy,6:8 
Just think about man in the 
last 100,000 years mostly living like Native Americans and how God must see 
us.  You need food, clothing and entertainment, money is to get those.  Man 
does not live on bread alone.  [C:/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,81941] Luke,4:4,
[C:/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,74130] Amos,8:11

God's favorite animals are bears and elephants.  They are funny shaped -- I 
think God must have seen too much starvation over the years.

God's ways are far above man's ways.  Mom said Heaven was a never-ending 
family reunion.  Yikes!  A friend said, "Most guy's idea of Heaven would be 
running around doing things they'd get locked up for on Earth."  Most people 
are like King Midas.  When you realize how silly most notions of Heaven are, 
you come to appreciate that Earth is not that bad.  This is the first step in 
loving God, the Creator -- praising Creation.  My parents spend their retired 
days watching TV and going to casinos.  That's not a good argument for
getting 
extended-play!

Imagine a billionare.  Everyone around him can't forget his money for even a 
moment.  The truth is, most people are after God's "money" -- they fear for 
their salvation.  Here's a test -- would you pray to and praise God even if 
there were no salvation?  Love God and don't be a "user".  Asking for stuff
is 
annoying.  [C:/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,81941] Luke,11:5 

All those sophisticated theological "infinity" things -- omniscience, 
omnipotence, omnipresence, omnivorous -- will mess you up.  Trust me that 
anthropomorphic is far better, in practice.  Christ suggested thinking of God 
as "Abba" which is Aramaic for "Daddy" and said the childlike had an 
advantage.  [C:/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,76908] Matthew,11:25  Pray out-loud because
God doesn't want the hastle 
of reading your brain.  The best way to stop people from testing God is to 
suggest He can't do everything.

Just as ego causes most to love neighbor, not God, people skip knowing and 
loving God and cowardly get stuck on obeying Him.  This hardly needs 
encouragement.

God does not want pawns to push around.  God will talk, but won't tell you 
what to do, even if you want Him to.  You'll quickly learn that prophecy does 
not come true and should smack yourself for wanting more than just enjoying 
God's company.

like it. Duh! He wants to be the hero. How do I know they died of

God.  School is more cruel.  Read [C:/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,12005] Numbers,11:1.
