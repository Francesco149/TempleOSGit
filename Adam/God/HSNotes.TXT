                             The Purpose of Life

The Catholic purpose of life is to know God, love God and obey God.  Pope 
Francis said it was "to serve the other."  I am High Priest of God's official 
temple and I say the purpose of life is to do continual offerings to God like 
Cain and Abel and enjoy God's response.  Francis has a charity; I have a 
church. Jesus said loving God was more important than loving neighbor.  
[C:/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,76908] Matthew,22:35-40  And, He did not say with half
your brain behind your back.

You don't know God.  [C:/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,34961] 1 Chronicles,28:9-9,
[C:/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,76908] Matthew,11:27-27, [C:/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,81941]
Luke,13:25-27, 
[C:/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,23902] 1 Samuel,3:6-8  You must talk with God to know
Him.  With Samuel, supposedly, 
God took the initiative, but I think that is the exception.  Seek the Lord by 
taking the initiative.  [C:/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,81941] Luke,11:9-10,
[C:/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,57332] Isaiah,30:1-2

There's something obviously different about people in the Bible compared to 
people today -- God talked!  Also, the people in the Bible were obsessed with 
doing offerings all the time.  It is required that you do offerings before
God 
will talk.  Did the people in the Bible hear voices?  Maybe.  More likely, 
they used occult techniques such as an oracle.  [C:/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,29345] 1
Kings,6:21  Have you heard 
of "tongues?"  [C:/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,92110] 1 Corinthians,14:1-40  The idea
is, you let yourself be 
puppeted by a spirit, so you say things.  You try to get a spirit -- the Holy 
Spirit -- to talk.  You might as well use a Ouija board.  However, it 
turns-out that a Ouija board is bad for technical reasons.  A really good 
technique is just randomly opening a book.  God told me in an oracle that it 
is a covenant that you hold-up your end of the conversation.  

You can't tell if God's talking unless you have a context of conversation, 
but, more importantly, you are commanded to do an offering of love, like 
communion preparation.  [C:/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,92110] 1 Corinthians,11:27  When
you pick a greeting card for 
someone, that is love effort.  If you expect God to put effort toward you,
you 
must put effort toward Him.  God said, "honest measures" applies between your 
offering of love and His response, like a fair barter.  You get out of prayer 
what you put into it.  God wants praise, hymns, or whatever you think He
might 
want.  Try and see, like Cain and Abel.  [C:/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,297]
Genesis,4:1-10, [C:/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,94514] Ephesians,5:10  God 
told Cain his offering was not good and told him to try again.  Cain really 
loved God!  Can you imagine being so heart-broken?

Do a text search for "new song" in the Bible.  It's mentioned nine times.  
When I hear a NEW awesome rock song, it is ecstasy for the first five times I 
hear it.  Soon, it brings little-to-no pleasure.  I did hymns
`#include "::/Apps/Psalmody/Load";JukeBox("::/Apps/Psalmody/Examples");`
 for God.  I also 
did Moses comics
`Dir("::/Apps/AfterEgypt/Comics");View;
`
 for God.  When you get to the gates of Heaven, St. Peter will 
ask how many times you gave blood.  That shows you loved neighbor.  You
better 
also be able to count the ways you loved God with all heart mind and soul.  I 
praised God for sand castles, popcorn, snowmen, bubbles...  You try putting 
effort into praise!  [C:/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,76908] Matthew,11:25,
[C:/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,76908] Matthew,6:28-29

This is funny -- [C:/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,87803] Acts,2:1-13 -- they didn't
bother to record anything the Holy 
Spirit said.  The Holy Spirit is supposed to be a really good gift.  
[C:/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,81941] Luke,11:11-13  Just remember, "Boys are made of
snakes and snails and 
puppy-dog tails."

The technique I use to consult the Holy Spirit is reading a microsecond-range 
stop-watch each button press for random numbers.  Then, I pick words or 
passages.  You can use the AfterEgypt
`#include "::/Apps/AfterEgypt/Run"`
 in God's official temple, TempleOS.

Since seeking the word of the Holy Spirit, I have come to know God much
better 
than I've heard others explain.  For example, God said to me in an oracle
that 
war was, "servicemen competing."  That sounds more like the immutable God of 
our planet than what you hear from most religious people.  God is not Venus 
(god of love) and not Mars (god of war), He's our dearly beloved God of
Earth. 
 If Mammon is a false god of money, Mars or Venus might be useful words to 
describe other false gods.  I figure the greatest challenge for the Creator
is 
boredom, ours and His.  What would teen-age male video games be like if war 
had never happened?  Christ said live by the sword, die by the sword, which
is 
loving neighbor as self.  [C:/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,76908] Matthew,26:52

I asked God if the World was perfectly just.  God asked if I was calling Him 
lazy.  God could make A.I., right?  God could make bots as smart as Himself, 
or, in fact, part of Himself.  What if God made a bot to manipulate every 
person's life so that perfect justice happened?

I think highs and lows balance.  [C:/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,81941] Luke,6:20-26  If
you laugh, you will cry.  If 
you cry, you will laugh.  Not one person has had great joy and not great 
sorrow.  I think this claim is falsifyable if you atheists want to find a 
counter-example to disprove it -- find a single person who had great joy and 
not great sorrow.  In Sirach, it says things happen in pairs.  You might be 
surprised examining your own life to see great joy was in proximity to great 
sorrow.  Pleasures and pains seem designed to balance.  Man must do manual 
labor and have pain.  Women must do child birth.  Pride and humility also 
balance -- pride before a fall and humility before honors.  Palm Sunday is 
juxtaposed to Good Friday.  Perhaps, being loved balances with being hated.  
[C:/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,43605] Job,1:1-22, in the Bible, had highs and lows that
balanced.  Joseph, in the 
Old Testament, had highs and lows that balanced.  [C:/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,297]
Genesis,39:17-22 

Jesus said, "Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who tresspass 
against us."  If you think about it, the only way you get forgiven is for it 
to be done to you.  That is a Jedi mind trick because it is nothing but
simple 
eye-for-eye tooth-for-tooth justice.  Live by the sword; die by the sword.  
The Bible is filled with justice pairs.  St. Paul persecuted Christians and 
gained forgiveness by getting persecuted.  King David almost got killed by 
Saul, [C:/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,23902] 1 Samuel,18:20-21 then he killed a guy and
took his wife.  
[C:/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,26892] 2 Samuel,11:15  Abraham almost killed his unloved
son, Ishmael.  
[C:/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,297] Genesis,21:16  That is why God asked Abraham to
kill Isaac.  God's favorite 
thing on TV is soap operas.

God hates complaining. [C:/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,12005] Numbers,11:1-35  Food and
clothing is all we're to ask 
for or demand, in fact -- daily bread.  [C:/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,95772] 1
Timothy,6:8  Just think about man in 
the last 50,000 years mostly living like Native Americans and how God must
see 
us.  You need food, clothing and entertainment, money is to get those.  Man 
does not live on bread alone.  [C:/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,81941] Luke,4:4,
[C:/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,74130] Amos,8:11-12

God's favorite animals are bears and elephants.  They are funny shaped -- I 
think God must have seen too much starvation over the years.  If the purpose 
of life is to know and love God, then a priest's job is to make everybody
know 
and love God.  By saying God likes bears and elephants, I did more toward
that 
end than all priests in history.  [C:/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,73189] Hosea,6:6  "It
is love that I desire, not 
sacrifice; knowledge of God, not holocaust."  As a former Catholic, that blew 
my mind.  I actually thought love was sacrifice!  I was so dumb-founded 
reading, "it is love that I desire, not sacrifice," that I actually looked-up 
the word, "love".  It means to take delight in.  I realized it is demonic 
pride if you think love means hurting yourself for others.  In the 
Philippians, they got the notion crucifying yourself was a good idea.  
Similarly, a child thinking about Lent, might conclude, "if it's bad, it must 
be good."  That is, if you think God wants you to hurt yourself to please
Him, 
you are worshiping a demon, not God!  God wants you to take delight in His 
company, get to know Him and praise Him.  It is best to separate justice -- 
sin and punishment -- from relationship with God.  Never ask God to change 
justice into injustice by not punishing.  God said to me in an oracle, 
"Excessive contrician wearisome."  He doesn't want to hear confessions.  When 
you pray, be witty and charming and rarely earnest.  Enjoy God's company 
without imposing on Him and don't expect secrets of the Universe. 
Earnestness 
in prayer is the head of much evil.  Be entertaining.  Don't remind Him of 
sin, LOL.

God's ways are far above man's ways.  Mom said Heaven was a never-ending 
family reunion.  Yikes!  A friend said, "Most guy's idea of Heaven would be 
running around doing things they'd get locked up for on Earth."  I wonder how 
long kids play Grand Theft Auto before getting board.  Perhaps, it takes ten 
years, but they will get bored.  Most people are like King Midas.  When you 
realize how silly most notions of Heaven are, you come to appreciate that 
Earth is not that bad.  This is the first step in loving God, the Creator -- 
praising Creation.  My parents spend their retired days watching TV and going 
to casinos.  That's not a good argument for getting extended-play!

Imagine a billionare.  Everyone around him can't forget his money for even a 
moment.  The truth is, most people are after God's "money" -- they fear for 
their salvation.  Here's a test -- would you pray to and praise God even if 
there were no salvation?  Love God and don't be a "user".  Asking for stuff
is 
annoying.  [C:/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,81941] Luke,11:5-7  Don't SPAM God. 

All those sophisticated theological "infinity" things -- omniscience, 
omnipotence, omnipresence, omnivorous -- will mess you up.  Trust me that 
anthropomorphic is far better, in practice.  Christ suggested thinking of God 
as "Abba" which is Aramaic for "Daddy" and said the childlike had an 
advantage.  [C:/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,76908] Matthew,11:25  Pray out-loud because
God doesn't want the hastle 
of reading your brain.  The best way to stop people from testing God is to 
suggest He can't do everything.

Jesus said, "I am meek and humble of heart."  [C:/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,76908]
Matthew,11:29  What does "humble 
of head" mean?  Humble of heart means you look around and say, "I don't care 
as much as they do."  A proud of heart person says, "I am superior because I 
have more compassion then everybody else."  If you are proud of heart, you 
don't accept a gift.  God gives birthrights.  Esau, in the Bible, scorned his 
birthright and God hated him.  [C:/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,76684] Malachi,1:2-3 
Jesus even accepted $30,000 
worth of perfume (300 day's wages) and caused Judas to betray him. 
[C:/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,79970] Mark,14:5  
If you express false outrage at wars, you are proud of heart.  If you fight
to 
go in the door last, e.g. "No, you first..." then you are proud of heart.  If 
you ask God to save starving Africans as though you care more than God, you 
are proud of heart.

I connected being humble of heart with animal sacrifices.  The animal 
sacrifices in the Bible really seem off-the-mark from what we modern people 
imagine truth to be!  I asked God and He said the people were, "primitive."  
Well, obviously, a sacrifice represents giving-up something of value, but is 
there more to it?  It would be tramatic to see a goat's throat being slit and 
it dying for your sins.  I'm not an expert, but sometimes they killed animals 
to make-up for sins. Perhaps, starting at age eight and every year
thereafter, 
they kill a goat for your sins?  (I'm just speculating.)  In a couple years, 
it is not tramatic and you yawn and say to the goat, "bummer for you, Mr. 
Goat, that you gotta die for my sins."  When a high school football team
beats 
their rivals, nobody thinks twice that the winning team really hurts the 
feelings -- devastates -- the losing team member's feelings.  The heart of 
being masculine is being competetive and not caring about the necessity to 
slit the throat of the goat.  As a Catholic, saying Jesus died for our sins 
and that we cannot earn salvation, never sat well.  I clung to the heretical 
notion that you earn salvation.  Animal sacrifices were the heart of Biblical 
Judaism and although it seems satanic, you really do have to slit the throat 
of the goat and accept grace, a term for something you did not earn.  Heck, 
every time you eat beef, a cow had to die for you.  God said to me in an 
oracle that having pets was, "homo."  I think God's idea of pets is farm 
animals you eat.

If you feel guilty for being American and want Mexicans to share your 
birthright, you are proud of heart.  Jesus was a racist and called Canaanites 
"dogs".  [C:/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,76908] Matthew,15:22-28  In an oracle, God told
me He was against 
immigration.  The Chinese intellectuals felt bad about not being laborers.  
Don't feel guilty about not being a laborer because God made it a Brave New 
World.  [C:/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,92110] 1 Corinthians,12:1-31

In an ant colony, the workers have one set of marching orders, the soldiers 
have another set of marching orders, the queen and drones have marching
orders 
and the diggers have marching orders.  The Bible gives conflicting orders -- 
conservatives pay attention to one set of passages and liberals pay attention 
to others.  Everybody has selective hearing, but that's good because we are 
different members of the body of Christ.

Jesus repeats the phrase, "for those who have ears to hear" many times, but 
not actually at the times that matter.  Jesus says several Jedi mind tricks
-- 
He asks, what father gives a scorpion to his son? 
[C:/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,81941] Luke,11:11-13 Jesus says, 
when you ask God for things, it is as annoying as like a neighbor in the 
night!  [C:/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,81941] Luke,11:5-7  He said, "I came to serve"
but Jesus' three years of 
service were more like being a rockstar than a janitor. 
[C:/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,85266] John,13:5-15

There are sheep and there are shepherds.  You would be silly to take other 
shepherds seriously when they are only caring for their sheep.  Sheep are
very 
hard to communicate to, as Jesus learned.  He used parables.  Seed on a path 
gets eaten by birds; weeds choke; and the one percent is rich soil.

Just as ego causes most to love neighbor, not God, people skip knowing and 
loving God and cowardly get stuck on obeying Him.  A desire to obey God, 
doesn't have to be encouraged, since it comes so naturally.  Don't worry, God 
does not want pawns to push around.  God will talk, but won't tell you what
to 
do, even if you want Him to.  Also, you'll quickly learn that prophecy does 
not come true and should smack yourself for wanting more than just enjoying 
God's company.
