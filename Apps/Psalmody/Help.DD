* The keyboard can be used as an organ by typing letter keys or clicking the 
mouse on the keyboard diagram.  You can "record" notes by pressing the red 
bttn and typing letters.  They will appear on the musical staff.  You can
edit 
and save them.

* The clip can be used to cut and paste.

* Psalmody uses [C:/Doc/HolyC.DD.Z,1] HolyC files as the song format!  See 
[C:/Apps/Psalmody/Examples/prosper.HC.Z,1].  The Psalmody program does not
fully 
parse the songs when loading them back in, so changes made outside Psalmody 
will be lost, like if you add graphics.

* The first line of the [C:/Doc/HolyC.DD.Z,1] HolyC song files is a comment
with a category 
recognized by [C:/Apps/Psalmody/JukeBox.HC.Z,1] JukeBox().  The categories
are "no nothing", "has words", "has 
graphics", or "special".  The third character in the song comment is a digit 
rating number, shown in [C:/Apps/Psalmody/JukeBox.HC.Z,1] JukeBox().  You can
set the song rating in [C:/Apps/Psalmody/JukeBox.HC.Z,1] JukeBox() 
by pressing 0-9.  You can request your reward from God by pressing r.  You
can 
press <DEL> to delete songs.

* You can take the [C:/Adam/ASnd.HC.Z,205] Play() stmts out of a song file
and place them in your 
programs.  You can also add a song to a document with <CTRL-l>, but you
should 
do it after pressing <CTRL-t> because the clip-insert in <CTRL-l> is screwy.

* You can call [C:/Apps/Psalmody/JukeBox.HC.Z,1] JukeBox("~/Psalmody"); to
play your songs.
