* The keyboard can be used as an organ by typing letter keys or clicking the 
mouse on the keyboard diagram.  You can "record" notes by pressing the red 
button and typing letters.  They will appear on the musical staff.  You can 
edit and save them.

* The clipboard can be used to cut and paste.

* Psalmody uses [C:/Doc/HolyC.TXT.Z,1] HolyC files as it's fmt!  See 
[C:/Apps/Psalmody/Examples/personal.CPP.Z,1].  It does not fully parse them
when 
loading back in, so changes made outside Psalmody can be lost.

* The first line of the [C:/Doc/HolyC.TXT.Z,1] HolyC song files is a comment
with a category 
recognized by [C:/Apps/Psalmody/JukeBox.CPP.Z,1] JukeBox().  The categories
are "no nothing", "has words", "has 
graphics", or "special".  The third character in the song comment is a digit 
rating number, shown in [C:/Apps/Psalmody/JukeBox.CPP.Z,1] JukeBox().  You
can set the song rating in [C:/Apps/Psalmody/JukeBox.CPP.Z,1] JukeBox() 
by pressing 0-9.  You can press <DELETE> to delete songs.

* You can take the [C:/Adam/Snd/SndMusic.CPP.Z,98] Play() statements out of a
song file and place them in your 
programs.  You can also add a song to a document with <CTRL-l>, but you
should 
do it after pressing <CTRL-t> because the clipboard-insert in <CTRL-l> is 
screwy.  See this <Song>
2qG3ECB2eGG3qCeFDsBGBG2qG3ECB2eGG3qCeFDsBGBGqEeEFqEB2eG3FetCAGqFCEeEFqEB2eG3Fe
tCAGqFC after pressing <CTRL-t>, now.

* You can call [C:/Apps/Psalmody/JukeBox.CPP.Z,1]
JukeBox("::/Home/Psalmody"); to play your songs.

* To create a .SND file which can be exported and played under Windows, set 
the Bool [C:/Kernel/KernelA.HPP.Z,3733] snd.record to TRUE, play music, and
set it to FALSE.  Then, call 
[C:/Adam/Snd/SndFile.CPP.Z,19] SndFileCreate().  You might wish to make a
<CTRL-ALT-key> to toggle this 
system level recording feat.  See [C:/Kernel/KMisc.CPP.Z,163] Snd().  Add
this code to your 
[C:/Home/AdamKeyPlugIns.CPP,1] file.

U0 CtrlAltR(I64)
{
  snd.record=!snd.record;
}
CtrlAltLetCBSet('R',&CtrlAltR,"Toggle snd.record");

* When calling [C:/Adam/Snd/SndFile.CPP.Z,19] SndFileCreate() you can set a
waveform.  The PC speaker is 
[C:/Adam/Snd/SndMath.CPP.Z,118] WF_SQUARE.  You can select reverb and
averaging, also.
