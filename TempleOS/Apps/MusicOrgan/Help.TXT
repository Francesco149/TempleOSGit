                               Music Organ Help

* The keyboard can be used as an organ by typing letter keys or clicking the 
mouse on the keyboard diagram.  You can "record" notes by pressing the red 
button and typing letters.  They will appear on the musical staff.  You can 
edit and save them.

* The clipboard can be used to cut and paste.

* MusicOrgan uses C+ files as it's fmt!  See 
[C:/TempleOS/Apps/MusicOrgan/Examples/personal.CPP.Z,1].  It does not fully
parse 
them when loading back in, so changes made outside MusicOrgan can be lost.

* The first line of the C+ files has a comment with a category recognized by 
[C:/TempleOS/Apps/MusicOrgan/JukeBox.CPP.Z,1] JukeBox().  The categories are
"no nothing", "has words", "has graphics", or "
special".  The third character in the comment is a digit rating number.

* You can take the [C:/TempleOS/Adam/Snd/Music.CPP.Z,104] Play() statements
out of a song file and place them in your 
programs.  You can also add a song to a document with <CTRL-L>, but you
should 
do it after pressing <CTRL-T> because the clipboard-insert in <CTRL-L> is 
screwy.  See this <Song>
2qG3ECB2eGG3qCeFDsBGBG2qG3ECB2eGG3qCeFDsBGBGqEeEFqEB2eG3FetCAGqFCEeEFqEB2eG3Fe
tCAGqFC after pressing <CTRL-T>, now.

* You can call [C:/TempleOS/Apps/MusicOrgan/JukeBox.CPP.Z,1]
JukeBox("HOME/MusicOrgan"); to play your songs.

* To create a .SND file which can be exported and played under Windows, set 
the Bool [C:/TempleOS/Kernel/KGlbls.CPP.Z,74] snd_record to TRUE, play music,
and set it to FALSE.  Then, call 
[C:/TempleOS/Adam/Snd/SndFile.CPP.Z,19] SndFileCreate().  You might wish to
make a <CTRL-ALT-key> to toggle this 
system level recording feat.  See [C:/TempleOS/Kernel/Misc1a.CPP.Z,189]
Snd().  Add this code to your 
[C:/TempleOS/Accts/TS/TAD/Adam3dKeyPlugIns.CPP,1] file.


U0 CtrlAltR(I64)
{
  snd_record=!snd_record;
}
SetCtrlAltLetCB('R',&CtrlAltR,"Toggle snd_record");


* The note accent feature only works when exporting songs.  When calling 
[C:/TempleOS/Adam/Snd/SndFile.CPP.Z,19] SndFileCreate() you can set a
waveform.  The PC speaker is [C:/TempleOS/Kernel/Adam1a.HPP.Z,3718]
WF_SQUARE.  You can 
select reverb and averaging, also.
