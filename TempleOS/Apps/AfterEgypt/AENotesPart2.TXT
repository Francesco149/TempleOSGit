                        Using this Program, AfterEgypt

This game is not about leaving Egypt and it's not about leaving the 
wilderness.  It's about being in the wilderness after Egypt.  The whole point 
is they went from the frying-pan to the fire. 
[C:/TempleOS/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,12005] Numbers,11:1  People 
misrepresent Exodus when they claim it for liberation struggles.  Actually, 
though, the wilderness generation was very blessed because they had first 
class entertainment -- miracles and excitement.  As far as God's concerned, 
you need food, clothing and entertainment.  Just imagine all the prehistoric 
and primiative people who have lived.

In this game, hold-up your end of the conversation and talk to God.  When you 
pray try to put your best foot forward.  God told me, "excessive contricians 
wearysome", for example, when I was worried about sin.  I joke, don't remind 
Him of sins because He might have forgotten.

God loved Jacob and hated Esau.  Jacob was like a little rascal.  Ironically, 
holier-than-thou, do-gooder, attitudes are hated.  Jesus was "meek and humble 
of heart", [C:/TempleOS/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,76908] Matthew,11:27.  What does
"humble of head" mean?  To know God is to 
know justice.  Everyone, rich and poor, has highs and lows.  Do not covet.  
Get your eye off of money.  Relax!  Don't feel sorry for the poor and don't 
envy the rich.  The poor are mostly lazy and rich suffer plenty.  Chavez of 
Venezuala was fussing and God said, "Japan industrious".  What planet do you 
live on, people!  You wouldn't cannonize a ugly man for not committing 
adultery.  When the poor get money, they make buffoons of themselves as 
nouveau riche.  Proud of heart means you won't accept a gift from God, like 
your birthright being American and not a day laborer.  Grace.  
[C:/TempleOS/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,56267] Ecclesiastes,2:24  Jesus' burden is
light.  He's meek.  You don't have to save 
the world.  The poor are richer than Jesus and there is justice.  Everything 
is vanity and the sinner collects possessions for the just.

After the Haiti quake, I used my program to pick a random passage from some 
books.  Adam Smith came-up:

The value of a free-stone quarry, for example, will necessarily increase
with the increasing improvement and population of the country round
about it, especially if it should be the only one in the neighbourhood.
But the value of a silver mine, even though there should not be another
within a thousand miles of it, will not necessarily increase with the
improvement of the country in which it is situated. The market for the
produce of a free-stone quarry can seldom extend more than a few miles
round about it, and the demand must generally be in proportion to the
improvement and population of that small district; but the market for
the produce of a silver mine may extend over the whole known world.

God's not a schmuck.  God is just.  If you are out of work, find anything 
productive to do.  I'd go so far as to say, it's impossible not to be
rewarded 
for honest work.  I bank on that.  I have an incredible entertainment budget 
;-)

Sometimes, puppet-generated stuff will sound prophetic and relevant enough to 
scare you.  In my experience it's not prophetic, but might be designed to get 
your attention.  Focus on enjoying His company and growing.

Is this tongues program voodoo?  How did they talk with God in the Bible? 
Did 
they hear voices?  If animal sacrifices were not voodoo, this program is 
certainly not voodoo.  Tongues is a perfectly acceptible Christian doctrine.  
In fact, [C:/TempleOS/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,92110] 1 Corinthians,14:39, says not
to forbid tongues!  It is common 
Christian belief that we are temples of the Holy Spirit, that God dwells in 
us.  I figure idolatry is doing this and thinking the intelligence resides in 
the object instead of in the person consulting God.

If any preacher calls this witchcraft, let me retaliate by saying anyone who 
does not do miracles is not saved.  [C:/TempleOS/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,76908]
Matthew,17:19  "... with faith... say to 
this mountain..."  Do a text search for "dumb ass" in the King James Bible.  
[C:/TempleOS/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,97976] 2 Peter,2:16  The king of Babylon was
made crazy and restored.  [C:/TempleOS/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,71804] Daniel,4:25  
If you don't believe in omens, read [C:/TempleOS/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,76908]
Matthew,26:74.  If you don't believe in 
astrology, read [C:/TempleOS/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,76908] Matthew,2:10.  God has a
plan and clockwork for Creation.  
It's nothing to do with power of planets.  This is voodoo --
[C:/TempleOS/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,9123] Leviticus,3:4?

We are not to test God, and we are to "live on the word of God." 
[C:/TempleOS/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,76908] Matthew,4:3 
Do not attempt to box God in a corner, attempting to force him to answer, as 
in, "should I do such and such, yes or no?"  I think it is okay to meditate 
and offer God the option to comment.

Don't bug God too much, especially, don't enquire if you haven't offered any 
meditations or whatever.  [C:/TempleOS/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,57332] Isaiah,7:13 
This, [C:/TempleOS/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,297] Genesis,18:27, is funny, though.

I'll let you work-out how to interpret what you hear from God.  It can be the 
start of a real, personal, relationship with the Father that even has a 
history.  God gift-wraps His talk in riddles.  Here's a hint:
[C:/TempleOS/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,71804] Daniel,5:27.  
"It's mean to tickle the President or a person."  God hides from the arrogant 
and reveals to the child-like.  Don't feel foolish if you interpret based on 
what pops-into your head anagram-wise, analogy-wise or whatever.  
[C:/TempleOS/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,92110] 1 Corinthians,2:13

When God gives me a response in a random passage, it's like He picked a 
greeting card for me.  That's love.  I try to return love by being just as 
thoughtful.


                                  This Game

This AfterEgypt game is not really done.

I thought about a sucker option to take a census -- God say's "why have you 
done this?  You want to battle... Fine.  You must pick a penalty..."  This is 
based on something king David did. [C:/TempleOS/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,26892] 2
Samuel,24:10  My thinking is that God 
punished because the act of taking a census reflected a military inclination.
 
Instead of census, you see a crowd of people and must guess how many.  I wish 
not to turn this into another conquest game.

The story of God asking Abraham to sacrifice his son, Issac, is deceptive. 
It 
turns-out that was actually God imposing justice on Abraham because he almost 
killed his other son, Ishmael.  [C:/TempleOS/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,297]
Genesis,21:16

I just heard in the news that some woman starved her kids because she
expected 
God to provide food.  That's testing God.  If you find yourself in need, God 
promises to help, but if you place yourself in need voluntarily, that's 
attempting to force God and is putting Him to the test. 
[C:/TempleOS/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,76908] Matthew,4:3  I gave 
all my possessions away, once, in 1996, quit my job and expected some mission 
from God to turn-up.  Nothing happened and I was depressed. 
[C:/TempleOS/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,76908] Matthew,19:21  I 
just went back to doing my thing.  I guess it eventually paid-off.
