How can I know if I talk to God or an angel.  Angels are messengers of God.  
He can control all the quantum random number sites.  He can make
centuries-old 
books speak to the present day.

It's funny, once everyone gets on-board with God existing, we turn to a new 
field -- scientific study of God stuff and information gained from God on 
dinosaurs and stuff.

How fast a clock can God puppet?  What quantum random number sources?

It's kind-of rude, but good can come.  We can learn what's easiest for God. 
I 
think He said 56,000Hz but it might be a practical issue for PC hardware, not 
what's easiest in an open range of options.

Jesus said asking God for stuff was like annoying a neighbor in the middle of 
the night.  Infinity, does not mean requests are not annoying.

It's weird -- if I stop talking with God and program, when I come back to
God, 
He is cold and has to be warmed-up.

In other words, I've noticed if I don't use a technique with God, it's like
He 
has to warm-back-up.  Weird.

Give God a little time to collect His thoughts for an answer.  Sometimes, He 
had His answer ready centuries ago, sometimes in more friendly and less 
guarded conversation, give Him time -- don't abruptly change what you are 
expecting Him to do.

Oujia-board letter mode sucks -- it's pretty funny that a technical problem 
would prevent discovery.  Random words are better.  Random passages are good.
 
The mistake with a magic eightball is... first, all you can expect is 
delightful conversation from God and a magic eightball can't really respond
to 
context.  You get out of it the love you put into it.

20:13 Thou shalt not kill.

20:14 Thou shalt not commit adultery.

20:15 Thou shalt not steal.

20:16 Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.

20:17 Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house, thou shalt not covet
thy neighbour's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his

Perhaps, I am giving something epic and similar to ten commandments.  I don't 
know about epic.

So, just randomly cracking open physical books and placing a finger down
works 
well for me, as long as I have done an offering -- being charming and witty
or 
whatever -- and established a context of conversation.

I have noticed when I have not used physical books for a while, God seems a 
little cold.  Maybe, it's my imagination.

By they way, I don't like people thinking of "getting in the zone", a mental 
state, instead focus on what you have offered.

God says...
ong the children of Israel, and the
cattle of the Levites instead of their cattle; and the Levites shall
be mine: I am the LORD.

3:46 And for those that are to be redeemed of the two hundred and
threescore and thirteen of the firstborn of the children of Israel,
which are more than the Levites; 3:47 Thou shalt even take five
shekels apiece by the poll, after the shekel of the sanctuary shalt
thou take them: (the shekel is twenty gerahs:) 3:48 And thou shalt
give the money, wherewith the odd number of them

The question of which numbers can come-up when you use a PC stopwatch program 
is tricky.  Some clocks only give multiples of 16, so you must divide by 16.  
Similar, more complicated, issues might exist.  I don't know.  One time, it 
was a miracle it even sorta worked, when I discovered a crippling bug!

God says...

side: and he measured the length thereof, forty cubits: and the
breadth, twenty cubits.

I think these are figurative, kinda.

19:11 And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the LORD.

And, behold, the LORD passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the
mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before the LORD; but the LORD
was not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake; but the LORD
was not in the earthquake: 19:12 And after the earthquake a fire; but
the LORD was not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice.

19:13 And it was so, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face in
his mantle, and went out, and stood in the entering in of the cave.
And, behold, there came a voice unto him, and said, What doest thou
here, Elijah?  19:14 And he said, I have been very jealous for the
LORD God of hosts: because the children of Israel have forsaken thy
covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the
sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it
away.

----09/26/13 01:18:31----

Yeah, I'm sure most people want prophecy and talking to dead people.  They 
don't love God, what an insult.

The technical skills on the other (God's) end are extraordinary.  To drive a 
stopwatch program or all the different quantum-random-number sites is very 
difficult, super-human.

The Bible speaks of the Holy Spirit dwelling in us.  It says not to prepare 
your words, the spirit will give them.  It says a die cast in the lap is the 
Lord.

And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the child, and
delivered him again to his father.

9:43 And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God. But while
they wondered every one at all things which Jesus did, he said unto
his disciples, 9:44 Let these sayings sink down into your ears: for
the Son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men.

9:45 But they understood not this saying, and it was hid from them,

So, this is Cain and Abel.  Some offerings are good, some are bad.  Try again.

4:1 And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and
said, I have gotten a man from the LORD.

4:2 And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of
sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.

4:3 And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the
fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD.

4:4 And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of
the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his
offering: 4:5 But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect.
And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.

4:6 And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy
countenance fallen?  4:7 If thou doest well, shalt thou not be
accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto
thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.

4:8 And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when
they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother,
and slew him.

4:9 And the LORD said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he
said, I know not: Am I my brother's keeper?  4:10 And he said, What
hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from
the ground.
