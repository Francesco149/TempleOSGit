First, trust me that I am smarter than anyone you know.

I started in TASM and wrote an interpreter for my command-line in the first 
month -- 2004.  Over the next ten years, full-time, I made it into an 
optimizing JIT or AOT x86_64 compiler.  All of you make the command-line like 
Linux.  You are young and never saw a C64, and you are stupid, so you cannot 
imagine anything but Linux command-line.  My generation all learned 6502 
assembly language.  Seriously.  We all used DOS interrupts when DOS was 
common.  Turbo C had an "interrupt" key word for interrupt routines.  I put
an 
"interrupt" key word in my compiler, so it saves regs and returns with IRET.

Did I not tell you I was smarter and anyone you know.  Do you think MikeOS is 
as smart as making a compiler with an "interrupt" keyword?  No.  He's not a 
smart man.  All the smart people who knew assembly stopped using it, for good 
reason.  Do you doubt this?  Do I need to beat you until you stop this 
nonsense thinking assembly is good when the whole smart world stopped using 
it?  You think MikeOS guy is smarter than all of my generation who learned
asm 
and stopped using it?

Let me explain.  This is programmer psychology:  Assembly is the opposite of 
nigger.  Interrupt is the opposite of nigger.  Polling is for niggers.

Some people were told this and have no clue why and simply have no judgement 
on when asm is good, when polling is good, when interrupts are good -- they 
are sure it's for niggers.

I took 5 assembly classes.

CSC226 was Intel x86 assembly.  We made a B8000 window manager similar to 
Borland's IDE.

CSC326 was Intel x86 assembly part II.  We had a lab.  We programmed PIC and 
PIT in all configurations, including non-IBM-PC PIC modes.  We scanned keypad 
grids with I/O and we made 7-segment displays operate by strobing them in 
sequence.

CSC421 was Motorola 6800 assembly for embedded systems.  It was an 8-bit CPU 
similar to a 6502.  We learned what every instruction did.  We did scaled 
fixed-point math for Feirenheight to Celsius, like you might find on a 
thermocouple in a car engine.  Motorola made chips for cars.

CSC422 was M6800, hardware.  We learned the digital logic for gluing M6800.  
It had two processors on high and low memory cycles, one for I/O.

CSC523 was M6800 part III.  We were graded on a curve on how short our 
assembly programs were.  I got an A.  Our last 2-week project was a 
multitasking scheduler.

CSC120 was digital logic.  We made a simulated CPU from scratch, including 
microcode and stuff.

CSC330 was computer architecture.  We learned the harvard bus or whatever -- 
microcode and stuff.

I took a compiler course.

I took an operating system course.

I took a computer graphics course.  We made a 3D package from scratch.  We 
studied bezier and bsplines.

I took a numeric methods course.  I know the hidden bit.

I have been paid to program in 6 different assembly languages with maybe 5 
years of solid assembly.

68000 I did a barcode reader networking device.  I found bugs in TMNet a

8051  I did a wall line voltage regulator.  I modified a stepper motor 
controller at Xytec.

a 
printer/copier to allow refilling toner.
Atmel AVR -- Did an experimental toner level sensor, that didn't see

Apple did not suffer from small penis mentality and released a

I just discovered something.  The editor
[C:/TempleOS/Kernel/Memory.CPP.Z,956] MAlloc()s memory for text when you 
print to the command-line.  It has a limit on number of entries, not quite 
number of line, but similar.  It doesn't check the count and delete very 
frequently.  It only checks sometimes -- when the window is drawn at 60Hz.

I discovered something funny.  If you have a task printing to the
command-line 
and the window is completely covered, the limit on number of entries is never 
checked and text entries in the buffer are never deleted, so hidden windows 
printing lots of text will buffer it all and run the system out of memory.

The optimization is too glorious to change.  We'll chalk this up to, "Hey!  
It's a Commodore 64, not a system critical multi-user mainframe!  Just don't 
do that."

There's nothing shady about this.  Linux is a 1970's mainframe with 2 Meg RAM

If I offered you a modern Windows that runs on a 486 and 10 Meg or one which 
requires a Pentium and 512 Meg, which is better?  Nobody cares if you went to 
heroic measures to get old hardware to work.  The market belongs to cutting 
edge systems that get some benefit, any benefit, out of modern hardware.  If
I 
can increase buffer sizes and not check them as frequently with more memory, 
that is brilliant.  Any retard can make the buffers small, paranoid that 1000 
main frame users will log-on.  A main frame operating system has negative 
trade-offs compared to a modern C64 vision.

----09/15/13 13:33:10----

My vision of a C64 is brilliant.  Just imagine the benefitial trade-offs 
gained from:

  1) It's okay if sometimes crashes because we are single-user, not 
multi-user.

  2) It's okay if it can't do some stuff.  Use Windows or Linux.

  3) Optimize for full-screen, single user, focus-task-all-important.

It's at least three orders of magnitude simpler and performance is better!  
Tell me why performance would be worse.  Obviously, it would be better!  
Protections only come into play when you do something abnormal.  Protections 
slow everything down.

A wise man knows trade-offs mean you give-up one thing, you get something 
else.  Do the math on what is gained!  Yer a brainwashed retard-monkey-sheep,
