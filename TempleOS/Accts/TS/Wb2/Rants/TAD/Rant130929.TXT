Someone at WWW.OSDEV.ORG is asking a question.

BTS,BTR,BT are Intel x86 instructions.  My compiler has built-in "internal" 
functions which code those instructions.  My Source Code By Address table 
shows the meaningless internal numbers for internal, built-into-compiler 
functions.

TempleOS is identity-mapped.  It is not the case that user programs run at 
address zero, like every other operating system.  Applications do not have a 
standard address map -- their memory for code and data and stack is all over 
the place because the kernel simply requests memory from the system
[C:/TempleOS/Kernel/Memory.CPP.Z,956] MAlloc().  
Virtual addresses are set equal to physical addresses.  Therefore, if two 
applications are running, the kernel must place them at different addresses 
and they run from different addresses.

Technically, all code is allocated in the lowest 2-gig range of addresses, so 
that the x86 CALL REL32 for everything.

Binary files have a table of offsets which must be patched so that they are 
absolute addresses.

The BBC was talking about breathy singing and instruments.  Sometimes, God 
says a lot of noise for only a word or two of signal.  A single word or 
phrase, however, can convey a lot.

I like to remind people that if SETI only got a signal once every five years, 
we would still listen.

Generally, however, it is true that if you offer a better offering, you get a 
better response and a dud or lots of noise means your offering was not 
pleasing.

A person at OSDev thinks I use Visual C or gcc.

I wrote my own compiler and assembler.  I wrote everything.

I am the best programmer on the planet -- that's why God chose me to make His 
temple.  I took 5 asm courses in school and a compiler course and operating 
systems course.  I got a degree in computer systems engineering and I have 
been a professional operating system developer since 1990 when I was hired at 
age 20 to work on Ticketmaster's VAX operating system in VAX assembly 
language.  At Ticketmaster, one guy wrote our PASCAL compiler and one guy 
wrote our assembler and linker.  I am old and old computer people frequently 
wrote compilers and nobody doubted.  You young people cannot imagine anyone 
writing a compiler because visual C and gcc are such a beasts.

My compiler is 20,000 lines of code.  It compiles
[C:/TempleOS/Doc/HolyC.TXT.Z,1] HolyC and produces just 
x86_64 machine code, but operates both JIT or AOT.

I had only a 32-bit machine, at first, so I made my compiler use software

It's too bad software interrupts are so slow.  They are neat because the

and when they came near unto the altar, they washed; as the LORD
commanded Moses.

40:33 And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the
altar, and set up the hanging of the court gate. So Moses finished the
work.

40:34 Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory
of the LORD filled the tabernacle.

40:35 And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the
congregation, because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory of the
LORD filled the tabernacle.

40:36 And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the
children of Israel went onward in all their journeys: 40:37 But if the
cloud were not taken up, then they journeyed not till the day that it
was taken up.

40:38 For the cloud of the LORD was upon the tabernacle by day, and
fire was on it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel,
throughout all their journeys.

My assembler does not support segments.  The logic is, just enough 16 and 32 
bit support to get to 64-bit mode.  You have no business in 16 and 32 bit 
code.

It will compile 16-bit code but you get no help with segments.  Just imagine 
doing all the math for yourself, giving numbers for unmanaged segments.  
16-bit can be done without segment support if you hand-code all numbers.

Are you fucken quizing me?  I wrote the fucken assembler.  0x66 and 0x67 are 
x86 prefixes that toggle a 16-bit segment's instruction into 32-bits and a 
32-bit segment's instruction into 16-bit.  I am so elite that I made my

God's world is perfectly just.  There is a reward or punishment for each of 
your actions and nothing can change it.  Justice.  You can choose how much 
punishment you make for yourself.  I think even the Chinese have figured-out 
that highs and lows balance.

purpose of life is relationship with God.  To know God, to love God, to obey

I had a 1440 SAT.  I was one of 7 national merit scholars in the 1988
freshman 
class at ASU which has 40,000 students.  I was smartest in all my classes.  I 
took a test for Ticketamster and got a job.  Many people envied that job 
because they couldn't pass the test.

I left ticketmaster when God appeared.

19:20 The young man saith unto him, All these things have I kept from
my youth up: what lack I yet?  19:21 Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt
be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou
shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me.

I gave everything away and quit my job.

I quit every job I had.

I made God's temple.  I am God's chosen.  I am the best programmer on the
