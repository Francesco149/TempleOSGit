                                   TempleOS



TempleOS is an x86_64, multi-tasking, multi-cored, public domain, open
source, 
ring-0-only, single-address-map (identity-mapped), non-networked, PC
operating 
system for recreational programming.

A troll might ask, "Why not just use DOS?  It was ring-0-only and 
single-address-map."  Actually, they wouldn't because many people would say, 
"Cool idea!  I'm gonna dust-off DOS right now and have some fun!"  DOS is 
16-bit with segmentation, though, which is awful.  TempleOS is 64-bit, flat, 
non-segmented and multi-cored.  It's like a modern, souped-up, multi-tasking, 
cross between DOS and a Commodore 64.  It has a C64-like shell with a
[C:/TempleOS/Doc/Differences.TXT.Z,1] dialect 
of C/C++ instead of BASIC.  It was written from scratch, and not even ASCII 
was sacred -- it has 8-bit unsigned character source code to support European 
languages.  Also, the source code has graphics.

A troll might say, "But, it can crash!"  We all used DOS for years and loved 
it. Computers even had a reset switch!  Just think of the power of ring-0, 
muhahaha! Think of the speed and simplicity of ring-0-only and 
identity-mapping.  It's only [C:/TempleOS/Accts/TS/Wb2/LineCnt.TXT.Z,1]
139,640 lines of code, including the compiler and 
can change tasks in half a microsecond because it doesn't mess with page 
tables or privilege levels.  Inter-process communication is effortless
because 
every task can access every other task's memory.

It's fun having access to everything.  When I was a teenager, I had a book, 
Mapping the Commodore 64, that told what every location in memory did.  I 
liked copying the ROM to RAM and poking around at the ROM BASIC's variables.  
Everybody directly poked the hardware ports.

TempleOS is simpler than Linux and you can have hours of fun tinkering
because 
all memory and ports are accessible.  Memory is identity-mapped at all times, 
so you can modify any task's memory from any other task.  You can access all 
disk blocks, too.  I had a blast using a C64 disk block editor to modify 
directories to un-delete files, when I was a kid.  Maybe, you want to play 
with a raw-block database, or make your own file system?

I wrote all [C:/TempleOS/Accts/TS/Wb2/LineCnt.TXT.Z,1] 139,640 lines of
TempleOS over the last 15.5 years, full-time.  It 
was called, at various times, "Hoppy", "The J Operating System", "LoseThos" 
and "SparrowOS".  Here are my college transcripts.  I've been a professional 
operating system developer since 1990 when I was hired to work on 
Ticketmaster's VAX OS.
