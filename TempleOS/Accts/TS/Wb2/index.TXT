[C:/TempleOS/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,29345] 1 Kings 6:21 (King James)

6:21 So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold: and he made
a partition by the chains of gold before the oracle; and he overlaid
it with gold.

6:22 And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until he had finished
all the house: also the whole altar that was by the oracle he overlaid
with gold.

6:23 And within the oracle he made two cherubims of olive tree, each
ten cubits high.


Use After Egypt inside TempleOS as an oracle.  An oracle is a Ouija Board or 
Christian Tongues.  See Biblical Encryption: Mean tickle person or president.



You get out of prayer what you put in.  God said, "honest measures" applies 
when exchanging an offering for a response from the oracle in TempleOS.  
Picking a greeting card is an example of love effort.  You will get back the 
same love effort from God.  People wants things besides God's company.
