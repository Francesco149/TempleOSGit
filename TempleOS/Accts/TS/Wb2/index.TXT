                     Nobody knows the Father but the Son.
         Do loving offerings.  Then, God will shine His love on you.
             Hell is the absence of God; Heaven is God's company.

(Slavery was just. In the movie, Titanic, the rich wore straight jackets. You 
must bow to authority to get authority. I do Moses comics as offerings. I 
said, "We're dying of malnutrician on manna."  Like Cain and Abel, God didn't 
like it. Duh! He wants to be the hero. How do I know they died of 
malnutrician?  Fuck Hollywood for making slavery worse than it was -- I love 
God.  School is more cruel.  Read [C:/TempleOS/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,12005]

TempleOS is an x86_64, multi-tasking, multi-cored, public domain, open
source, 
ring-0-only, single-address-map (identity-mapped), non-networked, PC
operating 
system for recreational programming.

The two most sacred and defining features of TempleOS are being ring-0-only 
and being identity-mapped.  Linux wants to be a secure, multi-user mainframe.
 
That's the vision for Linux.  That's why it has file permissions.  The vision 
for TempleOS is a modern, 64-bit Commodore 64.  The C64 was a home computer 
mostly used for games.  It trained my generation how to program.  It was 
simple, open and hackable.  It was not networked.  The games were not 
multimedia works of art, but generated programmatically with innocent, 
programmer (non-artist) quality graphics.  It was simple and unsecure.  If
you 
don't have malware and you don't have bugs, protection just slows things down 
and makes the code complicated.

A troll might ask, "Why not just use DOS?  It was ring-0-only and 
single-address-map."  Actually, they wouldn't because many people would say, 
"Cool idea!  I'm gonna dust-off DOS right now and have some fun!"  DOS is 
16-bit with segmentation, though, which is awful.  TempleOS is 64-bit, flat, 
non-segmented and multi-cored.  It's like a modern, souped-up, multi-tasking, 
cross between DOS and a Commodore 64.  It has a C64-like shell with
[C:/TempleOS/Doc/HolyC.TXT.Z,1] Holy C, a 
dialect of C/C++, instead of BASIC.  It was written from scratch, and not
even 
ASCII was sacred -- it has 8-bit unsigned character source code to support 
European languages.  Also, the source code has graphics.

A troll might say, "But, it can crash!"  We all used DOS for years and loved 
it. Computers even had a reset switch!  Just think of the power of ring-0, 
muhahaha! Think of the speed and simplicity of ring-0-only and 
identity-mapping.  It's only [C:/TempleOS/Accts/TS/Wb2/LineCnt.TXT,1] 129,664
lines of code, including the compiler and 
can change tasks in half a microsecond because it doesn't mess with page 
tables or privilege levels.  Inter-process communication is effortless
because 
every task can access every other task's memory.

It's fun having access to everything.  When I was a teenager, I had a book, 
Mapping the Commodore 64, that told what every location in memory did.  I 
liked copying the ROM to RAM and poking around at the ROM BASIC's variables.  
Everybody directly poked the hardware ports.

TempleOS is simpler than Linux and you can have hours of fun tinkering
because 
all memory and ports are accessible.  Memory is identity-mapped at all times, 
so you can modify any task's memory from any other task.  You can access all 
disk blocks, too.  I had a blast using a C64 disk block editor to modify 
directories to un-delete files, when I was a kid.  Maybe, you want to play 
with a raw-block database, or make your own file system?

I wrote all [C:/TempleOS/Accts/TS/Wb2/LineCnt.TXT,1] 129,664 lines of
TempleOS over the last 15.5 years, full-time, 
including the 64-bit compiler.  It was called, at various times, "Hoppy", "
The J Operating System", "LoseThos" and "SparrowOS".  Here are my 
college transcripts.  I've been a professional operating system developer 
since 1990 when I was hired to work on Ticketmaster's VAX OS.

                             The Purpose of Life

The purpose of life is to know, love and obey God.  Christianity is loving 
neighbor, not God -- secular humanism.  Jesus said loving God is more 
important than loving neighbor.  [C:/TempleOS/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,76908]
Matthew,22:36  He did not say with half your 
brain behind your back.

You don't know God.  [C:/TempleOS/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,34961] 1 Chronicles,28:9,
[C:/TempleOS/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,76908] Matthew,11:27,
[C:/TempleOS/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,81941] Luke,13:25, 
[C:/TempleOS/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,23902] 1 Samuel,3:7  You must talk with God to
know Him.  [C:/TempleOS/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,76908] Matthew,6:6  Seek Him by 
taking the initiative.  [C:/TempleOS/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,81941] Luke,11:9,
[C:/TempleOS/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,57332] Isaiah,30:2

There's something obviously different about people in the Bible compared to 
people today -- God talked!  Did they hear voices?  Maybe.  More likely, they 
used occult techniques such as an oracle. 
[C:/TempleOS/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,29345] 1 Kings,6:20  Have you heard of 
"tongues?"  [C:/TempleOS/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,92110] 1 Corinthians,14:1  The idea
is, you let yourself be puppeted by a 
spirit, so you say things.  You try to get a spirit -- the Holy Spirit -- to 
talk.  You might as well use a Ouija board.  However, it turns-out that a 
Ouija board is bad for technical reasons.  A really good technique is just 
randomly opening a book.  God said it is a covenant that you hold-up your end 
of the conversation.  

You can't tell if He's talking unless you have a context of conversation,
but, 
more importantly, you are commanded to do an offerring of love, like
communion 
preparation.  When you pick a greeting card for someone, that is love effort.
 
God said, "honest measures" applies between your offering of love and His 
response, like a fair barter.  You get out of prayer what you put into it.  
God wants praise, hymns, or whatever you think He might want.  Try and see, 
like Cain and Abel.  [C:/TempleOS/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,297] Genesis,4:1,
[C:/TempleOS/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,94514] Ephesians,5:10  God told Cain his
offering 
was not good and told him to try again.  Cain really loved God!  Can you 
imagine being so heart-broken?

Do a text search for "new song" in the Bible.  It's mentioned nine times.  I 
did hymns
`#include
"::/TempleOS/Apps/MusicOrgan/Load";JukeBox("::/TempleOS/Apps/MusicOrgan/Exampl
es");`
.  I did Moses comics
`Dir("::/TempleOS/Apps/AfterEgypt/Comics");View;
`
.  Count the ways you love God.  I praised God 
for sand castles, popcorn, snowmen, bubbles...  You try putting effort into 
praise!  [C:/TempleOS/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,76908] Matthew,11:25,
[C:/TempleOS/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,76908] Matthew,6:29

This is funny -- [C:/TempleOS/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,87803] Acts,2:1 -- they didn't
bother to record anything the Holy 
Spirit said.  The Holy Spirit is supposed to be a really good gift.  
[C:/TempleOS/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,81941] Luke,11:13  Just remember, "Boys are
made of snakes and snails and puppy-dog 
tails."

The technique I use to consult the Holy Spirit is reading a microsecond-range 
stop-watch each button press for random numbers.  Then, I pick words or 
passages.  You can use the AfterEgypt
`#include "::/TempleOS/Apps/AfterEgypt/Run"`
 in God's official temple, TempleOS.

Since seeking the word of the Holy Spirit, I have come to know God much
better 
than I've heard others explain.  God said, for example, that war was, 
"servicemen competing."  That sounds more like the immutable God of our
planet 
than what you hear from most religious people.  God is not Venus (god of
love) 
and not Mars (god of war), He's our dearly beloved God of Earth.  If Mammon
is 
a false god of money, Mars or Venus might be useful words to describe other 
false gods.  I figure the greatest challenge for the Creator is boredom, ours 
and His.  What would teen-age male video games be like if war had never 
happened?  Christ said live by the sword, die by the sword, which is loving 
neighbor as self.  [C:/TempleOS/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,76908] Matthew,26:52

I asked God if the World was perfectly just.  God asked if I was calling Him 
lazy.  I think highs and lows balance.  [C:/TempleOS/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,81941]
Luke,6:20  I don't think God likes 
complaining.  [C:/TempleOS/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,12005] Numbers,11:1  Food and
clothing is all we're to ask for or 
demand, in fact -- daily bread.  [C:/TempleOS/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,95772] 1
Timothy,6:8  Just think about man in the 
last 100,000 years mostly living like Native Americans and how God must see 
us.  You need food, clothing and entertainment, money is to get those.  Man 
does not live on bread alone.  [C:/TempleOS/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,81941] Luke,4:4,
[C:/TempleOS/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,74130] Amos,8:11

God's favorite animals are bears and elephants.  They are funny shaped -- I 
think God must have seen too much starvation over the years.

God's ways are far above man's ways.  Mom said Heaven was a never-ending 
family reunion.  Yikes!  A friend said, "Most guy's idea of Heaven would be 
running around doing things they'd get locked up for on Earth."  Most people 
are like King Midas.  When you realize how silly most notions of Heaven are, 
you come to appreciate that Earth is not that bad.  This is the first step in 
loving God, the Creator -- praising Creation.  My parents spend their retired 
days watching TV and going to casinos.  That's not a good argument for
getting 
extended-play!

Imagine a billionare.  Everyone around him can't forget his money for even a 
moment.  The truth is, most people are after God's "money" -- they fear for 
their salvation.  Here's a test -- would you pray to and praise God even if 
there were no salvation?  Love God and don't be a "user".  Asking for stuff
is 
annoying.  [C:/TempleOS/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,81941] Luke,11:5 

All those sophisticated theological "infinity" things -- omniscience, 
omnipotence, omnipresence, omnivorous -- will mess you up.  Trust me that 
anthropomorphic is far better, in practice.  Christ suggested thinking of God 
as "Abba" which is Aramaic for "Daddy" and said the childlike had an 
advantage.  [C:/TempleOS/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,76908] Matthew,11:25  Pray out-loud
because God doesn't want the hastle 
of reading your brain.  The best way to stop people from testing God is to 
suggest He can't do everything.

Just as ego causes most to love neighbor, not God, people skip knowing and 
loving God and cowardly get stuck on obeying Him.  This hardly needs 
encouragement.

God does not want pawns to push around.  God will talk, but won't tell you 
what to do, even if you want Him to.  You'll quickly learn that prophecy does 
not come true and should smack yourself for wanting more than just enjoying 
God's company.

                          God's Temple is Finished.
                 Now, God kills the CIA+FBI until it spreads.
               (The CIA+FBI stand in the way, for the moment.)


There will be no PCI or later supported hardware.  (It only supports 64-bit 
multicored CPUs, however, and my compiler and binary file formats are pure 
64-bit.)  Once my enemies realize it's God, I will make demands.  I do not
add 
clusterfucked shit to God's Temple -- I demand them to change.  It sounds 
absurd, but I have God.  They WILL comply.  Microsoft will support RedSea 
filesystem and I will remove support for FAT32.  God's temple will be perfect 
and not blemished with any flaws or redundancy.  PCI devices diverge into
many 
many branches and are clusterfucked.

I did an HD Audio driver -- I thought it would become standard.  You must 
connect together many widgets that can vary from machine to machine with HD 
Audio.  It's impossible.  On fucken top of that, VMware doesn't support my HD 
Audio -- all that work on that driver was worthless.  I removed it.  Internal 
PC speaker is incredibly beautiful, by comparison, and a one-voice song 
language for music is a pure delight.  God said one audio voice, like He said 
640x480 16 color.  He wants one driver for each different type of device. 
The 
CIA hates PC Internal speaker because it is a digitial I/O for bombs or 
something.  VMware spitefully removed support for PC internal speaker.  They 
WILL put it back.  They are evil.  They played musical chairs with IDE
devices 
for no reason but to fuck-up new operating systems.  Microsoft added Secure 
Boot to fuck-up alternative operating systems, so you can't dual boot.  Da 
fuck?  Anti-trust, FBI, the hell you going after the victim fer?  I'm a 
supplemental operating system that needs a partner so people can do web
stuff. 
 I don't have networking -- that's not what I'm about.  Things are really 
fucked-up.  Do you remember RS232 with generic terminal connections to user 
hardware?  USB is absolutely clusterfucked.  I'm just counting on legacy
mode, 
not doing USB -- it's fine, but not having solid state sticks sucks.  I 
support ISO9660 CD-ROM.  I got specs on UDF.  That's clusterfucked. 
Microsoft 
WILL add support for burning ISO9660 and burning a CD/DVD from ISO files.  I 
can generate ISO files.  

Judgement Day motha fuckas!  You WILL comply.

CIA+FBI bodies must die.  It's in the Bible under Exodus.  Nobody gives a
shit 
until bodies hit the floor.  Even with 7 plagues, Pharaoh did not let them go 
and came after the Jews into the Red Sea and God killed them.  The CIA+FBI 
will die because it's God talking.  Fuck You!  My Dad is CIA, mother fucker, 
an enemy -- in cahoots with the doctors and CIA.
