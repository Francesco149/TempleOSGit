                                   TempleOS

I changed the name to TempleOS because I didn't like "SparrowOS" and God
seems 
okay with it being His official temple.

Now, I need an icon kind of thing -- some kind of identifiable graphics.

Whatchu think, God?

God says...
gods Fathers lengthened god continuance imitated apprehend dies betters 
salvation hesitated orator recurring exuberance goeth settled ours beasts 
littles safe far unsettled Awake Offices hath muttering nourishment Run 
covenant whitherward family slain composing tumult inordinate foreshow
honours 
shadows disapproveth confine hellish 

Shadows on my cross image are off.  :-)
