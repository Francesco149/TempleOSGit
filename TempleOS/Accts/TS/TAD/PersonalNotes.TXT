* Bug: Back-up-script cause jumps back and forth in ToHtml.

* Bug? Hung after pressing CmpMain in personal menu.  Haven't seen in a while.
* Crashes after back-up-script.  Went away maybe after spurious IRQ fix.
* Music organ hangs when cursoring around.  Haven't seen in while.

* [C:/TempleOS/Adam/Doc/DocRecalc.CPP.Z,1800] DocUpdateTaskDocs() used to skips locked docs. [C:/TempleOS/Adam/Window.CPP.Z,614] WinMgrSync() needs to check?

* Why was wordstat so slow on "OldMasterBootWrite" for example.

* [C:/TempleOS/Adam/Doc/DocMain.CPP.Z,46] Plain() might be better not saving [C:/TempleOS/Kernel/Adam1a.HPP.Z,3193] CH_CURSOR.

* TRANSPARENT might not work with line ROPF_DITHER

* It would be nice if [C:/TempleOS/Compiler/Unassembler.CPP.Z,866] U() NOP were better.

* Autoindent is very bad.

* Make native file system expanded size set in Copy.

GrEdit: Move sidebar selected elems.
	- Be careful of multipt elems.
GrEdit: Strip origin shift cmds.

GrEditBitMap, grabscroll? 
GrEditBitMap, cut/paste boxes.

extern of fun with dft arg of str?

* We kinda need a routine to return how much free memory, so that
applications 
can plan a big alloc.

* FileMgr bad with lots of files.  

* This [C:/TempleOS/Kernel/TaskCmd.CPP.Z,1] Fs->catch_except=TRUE causes
problems because it catches divide and 
out-of-mem.  Not sure what to do, yet.
* [C:/TempleOS/Kernel/MultiProc.CPP.Z,400] MPStart() free old task memory.
(Prolly never gonna do anything about this.)
* [C:/TempleOS/Kernel/Adam1b.HPP.Z,129] sys_var_init_flag local vars.
* sprite shift pts, ctrl pt for ellipse/polygon w,h is off when rotated.

* Window mgr needs to do DOC operations on posted messages from mouse.  Works 
for [C:/TempleOS/Kernel/KbdMouse/InputPointer.CPP.Z,74] SetIP(), though.

* Add local vars to sym table in [C:/TempleOS/Kernel/Dbg1a.CPP.Z,691] Dbg()? 
(maybe)

This shit:



* [C:/TempleOS/Adam/Doc/DocRecalc.CPP.Z,1] Bible sized nodes
* Mouseinstall throws exceptions, doesn't work, investigate Mouse
[C:/TempleOS/Kernel/KbdMouse/Mouse.CPP.Z,1] 0x9FC30
* get kbd lights working.
* figure-out hyperthread vs nonhyperthread CPU's
* Might have issue with compiler exceptions and restoring lex.hash tables.
* Generates two compiler error messages for expressions in statements.
* release semaphores or break lock sema,usb_td
* Fix Mom's secondary CD-ROM, dad's primary
* pmtstr in install didn't like focus change

*U0 Main()
{
  U0 (*fp_old_draw_input_ptr)(CDC *dc,I64 x,I64 y)=fp_draw_input_ptr;
}

* Syncronize VGA memory update with the hardware refresh cycle.

* Demo [C:/TempleOS/Adam/ToHtml.CPP.Z,318] ToHtml().

* Del short name in FAT32--currently I do not check to see if I have
generated 
a unique short name and one can delete multiple files accidentally.  
Generating unique short names is a pain in the ass because you have to scan 
the whole directory.  I think I just truncate the name instead of "Program~1" 
or whatever. S081130-0001.BMP crashed windows--two identical short names.

* OVERSTRIKE at cmd line with menu macro.

* lock{} warning on invalid modes.
* Local array vars-->reg.
* [C:/TempleOS/Kernel/Adam1a.HPP.Z,3303] DCF_SYMMETRY, before transformation?
(Currently it's after) 
* all graphics clipping -- screen y+top<0 for top<0
* Maybe convert graphics to float
* compiler F32
* preempt(OFF) during graphic clipping?
* compiler optimization heap_glbls with added offset
* AOT-compile extern glblvar references. 
* extern glbl var in AOT module on data heap.
* Might make FAT32 read in contiguous chunks.
* make Limit(),Min(),Max() asm routines.
* Might make CSprite flood fill operate on a separate bitmap and blotted at 
the end.
* autofile popup of popup
* <CTRL-R> delete subsprite in menu near others
* consider changing domenu so a real <ESC> on menu item doesn't select
(<SPACE 
BAR> sends <ESC> followed by <SPACE BAR> or something)
* puts3 with depth buf?  might not do this
* make task queins and querem safe for multicore cycling through tasks (fwd).
* make better heapwalk, do something with _CFG_HEAP_DBG.
* log to file--would be inefficient--load-in whole file, modify and write
out. 
 Useful, but not very efficient  (TempleOS file system has no grow-file 
ability.  Created when FAT patent was an issue and wanted absly nothing
people 
could sue me for.)
* APIC2
* import intel datasheets, somehow?
* Might make DskView show drive colors.
* Might do utility to set drive colors, making a tree entry in Adam 3 using 
registry-like routines... or registry I guess.

* New Editor widgets

* Make use of flag potential in SysFilesFind and possibly CFileAccess
* implement fixed pos files

* new C+ language features
* better debugging

* Change hardcoded stuff to Define
* Too much preemption turned off?
* Look for mem leaks.
* Move stuff out of Kernel module.

* [C:/TempleOS/Kernel/Adam1a.HPP.Z,2749] ROP_XOR with pen_width>1 is broken.

* use width and height in line clipping for pen_width>1 or blot.
* SIMD transformation
* test removable media id  (critical for resident files)

* add field overflow U8 "t='*'"
* Implement fmt codes into GetF
* GetF date codes and maybe h fmts for nums
* Date Input
* Default date fmt

* 16 bit Unassembly is bad--very low priority
* more signed int disassembly
* support r4u8 by adding 0x40 byte
* static var off of data heap.
* Might want to use U32*U32 multiplication.
* could add "const" to not set LF_NOT_CONSTANT flag for trig, etc.
* do r,rm ICCmp like ICBrCmp
* could make glblvar imports use TY_RIP_DISP32.
* PUSH_CMP allocs reg R9 or whatever
* Might be problem with NOP in OPT pass1 for NO_PUSH in expressions besides 
assignments.  Is ShiftNoPush fully implemented?
* NOP1 might need to have diff ic_data's
* in divequal, it assumes about ebx
* error/warning line nums
* ASM branch out warning of range off by 1 line--use lx->last_line_num

* Switch statement with sparse cases (low priority)
* maybe inline functions?
* Use of more floating-point stk?

* More aggressive in this routine [C:/TempleOS/Compiler/OptPass3.CPP.Z,29]
CmpF2PushPop() with types besides MOV and 
F64. 
* !dbl ~dbl
* &=, |= can overflow with Bts Btr on small data types

* num lock comes on with break key
* sort options for findfiles
* recalc_start could be more accurate before recalculating?
* Maybe, get rid of [C:/TempleOS/Compiler/CmpMain.CPP.Z,1] 0x20000 in
compiler.
