The cmd line feeds into the [C:/TempleOS/Doc/HolyC.TXT.Z,1] Holy C compiler
as you type.  A statement outside 
a function executes immediately.  Remember to add a semicolon.

Look-up the function headers with WordStat by hitting <CTRL-SHIFT-F1> after

[C:/TempleOS/Kernel/Dsk/Dsk1b.CPP.Z,235] Click Here to see the directory cmd
header.  It accepts default args from C++.

Dir("*.TXT.Z");

If you don't have args, you don't need parenthesis.

Dir;

There is a current directory, but not a path.  To run a program, you
typically 
#include it.  There are several shortcuts for #includeing files.  Right-click 
or hit enter on a directory lsting or press F5 while editing.

Ed("NewFile.CPP.Z");

Most filenames end in ".Z" because they are stored compressed.

Drives are specified with a letter.  The boot drive is specified with a ':'.

Drv('B');		B drive

The drive can be specified in a [C:/TempleOS/Kernel/Dsk/Dsk1b.CPP.Z,38] Cd()
command as in:

Cd("B:/Temp");		B drive
Cd("::/TempleOS/Demo");	Boot drive

Cd("HOME/MusicOrgan");	HOME is a dir

You can place macros in your personal menu for
