"Input Ptr" is the mouse at this point.

[C:/TempleOS/Kernel/KGlbls.CPP.Z,82] ipx and
[C:/TempleOS/Kernel/KGlbls.CPP.Z,82] ipy can be used to access the x and y
coordinates of the input ptr.  
They are relative to the screen, not window.  These can be used if you don't 
want to use msg passing.  [C:/TempleOS/Kernel/KGlbls.CPP.Z,82] ipz is the
wheel.

[C:/TempleOS/Kernel/KGlbls.CPP.Z,88] iptx and
[C:/TempleOS/Kernel/KGlbls.CPP.Z,89] ipty are the text column and row of the
input ptr.  See 
[C:/TempleOS/Demo/Maze.CPP.Z,1].

You can make the input ptr snap to a grid by adjusting Fs->snap.
