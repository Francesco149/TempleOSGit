A Character is a single byte holding an ASCII code for a letter, num or sym.  
The TempleOS term is a U8.

ASCII values range from 0 to 127.  Values below 32 are ctrl key's.  So, an 
ASCII #3 is a <CTRL-C>.  TempleOS uses a few nonstandard values.  In TempleOS 
ASCII #5 is the cursor location, ASCII 28 is <SHIFT-ESC> and ASCII #31 is a <S
HIFT-SPACE>.  See [C:/TempleOS/Kernel/Adam1a.HPP.Z,3221] Char Definitions.

A Key is typically specified with a scan code.  TempleOS scan codes contain 
the key value in the lowest U8, and flags in the upper bytes.  See 
[C:/TempleOS/Kernel/Adam1a.HPP.Z,3242] Scan Code Flags and
[C:/TempleOS/Kernel/Adam1a.HPP.Z,3276] Scan Codes.

TempleOS stores scan codes in 8 bytes.
  Byte 0   is the code with left and right keys combined.
  Byte 1-3 are flags
  Byte 4   is the code with left and right distinct.
  Byte 5-7 are flags

Run the program [C:/TempleOS/Demo/MsgLoop.CPP.Z,1] to examine scan code.

A String is a bunch of ASCII characters terminated with a zero.
