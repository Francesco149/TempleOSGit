                                 Cut Corners

There are a few places where I cut corners in the interest of not junking-up 
code.  This is part of the TempleOS mentality.  I try not to let, often 
stupid, legacy compatibility issues enter and junk-up TempleOS.

* I made my type-casting operator post-fix because it makes the compiler way 
cleaner.

* TempleOS does not figure-out FAT32 short name alias numbers. 
[C:/TempleOS/Kernel/Dsk/FileSysFAT.CPP.Z,601] FAT32DirNew(). 
 It can cause hard drive corruption, so I might have to do it.  It would 
really take a lot of junky code for this hatefully, detestable, legacy issue.
 
"Please don't make me ruin my beautiful shiny-new TempleOS with that!"  I am 
also not enthused about FAT32 because it is in patent limbo.  FAT32 might get 
removed from TempleOS.  There is a TempleOS native, 64-bit, file system that 
works perfectly well.  FAT32 is useful, however, because it assists in 
transferring between dual booted operating systems.

* I changed the [C:/TempleOS/Compiler/OpCodes.TXT.Z,1] asm opcodes names to
remove the ambiguity between instructions 
with different numbers of arguments, making my
[C:/TempleOS/Compiler/Assembler.CPP.Z,1] assembler simpler and I did 
minimal 16-bit asm support, since 64-bit is what you should be using, unless 
you're doing a [C:/TempleOS/Adam/Boot/BootCD.CPP.Z,1] boot loader.

* There are no file-sharing locks of any kind.  You're on your own.
