A TempleOS document is a [Circular Queue,1] Circular Queue of cmds and
graphics.  See [C:/TempleOS/Kernel/Adam1a.HPP.Z,1342] CDocEntry 
for the entry structure.  See [C:/TempleOS/Adam/Training.CPP.Z,203]
TipOfDay() for a nice example.

There is one document format for the editor/ viewer/ browser/ cmd line.

Each task has a [C:/TempleOS/Kernel/Adam1a.HPP.Z,1518] CDoc queue.  There is
one [C:/TempleOS/Kernel/Adam1a.HPP.Z,1518] CDoc for the border, called 
"auxiliary" and one for the main window.  The aux is at Fs->next_doc and the 
main at Fs->last_doc.  When dbl buffering, there are two main's.  See 
[C:/TempleOS/Demo/Spy.CPP.Z,1].  It is possible to define multiple aux's.  To
insert 
a additional aux, use [C:/TempleOS/Adam/Doc/DocNew.CPP.Z,765]
DocQueInsRev(doc,Fs->next_doc).

See[C:/TempleOS/Demo/Doc/CallBack.CPP.Z,1] and
