WordStat collects statistics from all text files in subdirectories when you 
call [C:/TempleOS/Adam/WordStat/WSMain.CPP.Z,651] WSInit().  It counts which
words follow which other words with what 
frequency in a big sparse matrix.

It provides auto-complete typing and jump-to-code or 
jump-to-dictionary_definition functionality.

Tip: If you use consistent var names for items of different classes, you'll 
usually be able to autocomplete the member vars.  I always use lx for
[C:/TempleOS/Kernel/Adam1a.HPP.Z,2135] CLex 
ptrs; doc for [C:/TempleOS/Kernel/Adam1a.HPP.Z,1518] CDoc ptrs; doc_e or
doc_ce for [C:/TempleOS/Kernel/Adam1a.HPP.Z,1342] CDocEntry ptrs, etc.

If you have the raw Project Gutenberg dictionary file, you can generate the 
TempleOS processed dictionary files with the stand-alone program 
[C:/TempleOS/Adam/WordStat/WSDictGen.CPP.Z,1].
