                            Clearing-up Confusions

* I, Terry A. Davis, wrote every one of the 129,664 lines of TempleOS over
the 
past 15.5 years (full-time).  It runs on bare hardware with no layering, 
libraries, tools, modules or anything from other sources.  It's 100% 
independent and stands alone.  It has no networking and certainly doesn't
call 
home.  Every line of TempleOS src code is including in all distro's, from the 
kernel to the compiler to the boot loaders.

* TempleOS does not execute code not written by me and any time except for a 
few BIOS calles for cfguration.

* TempleOS is 100% independent -- it does not access the files of your
primary 
operating system.  It will work as the only operating system on your computer.

* TempleOS is 100% written from scratch.  There is no Linux or GNU or any 
other code in TempleOS.  Yes, I wrote the compiler from scratch.  (I probably 
need to repeat this a few times.)

* TempleOS is an operating system, not a browser.  The cmd line has active 
links.  They link to local files.

* TempleOS compiles, not "interprets", and uses no "byte code" anywhere.  I 
use the word "script" sometimes for stuff, but it's actually compiled.

* I am an evolutionist.  "Adam" is a better term for the father of all tasks 
than "root" was!

* [C:/TempleOS/Kernel/Adam1b.HPP.Z,57] Bt() is "bit test", like the x86
instruction, not "bit torrent".

* [C:/TempleOS/Kernel/Adam1b.HPP.Z,284] Fs is a segment register, not "file
system".  (It is kept pointing to the 
current task's record.)  There is no memory segmentation -- FS and GS are
used 
as general purpose registers, more or less.

* TempleOS uses a dialect of C/C++ called [C:/TempleOS/Doc/HolyC.TXT.Z,1]
Holy C.  It is not PASCAL.  I 
altered the syntax making parenthesis optional on function calls with no 
paramaters.

* [C:/TempleOS/Kernel/Misc1a.CPP.Z,178] Sleep() makes a program pause.  It is
not hybernation for a laptop.

* [C:/TempleOS/Kernel/Scheduler.CPP.Z,369] Yield() saves the current task's
registers (context) and loads in the next 
task.  When waiting, it's better to do this than check a condition in a loop 
until you get preempted.  Checking a condition until you get preempted wastes 
CPU.  TempleOS does not use virtual memory, so
[C:/TempleOS/Kernel/Scheduler.CPP.Z,369] Yield() involves no disk 
activity.  A swap takes half a microsecond.  See 
[C:/TempleOS/Demo/Lectures/Spinning.CPP.Z,1].

* I use the term [C:/TempleOS/Doc/Glossary.TXT.Z,1] JIT Compile Mode.  This
means it is compiled and executable 
code placed into mem, ready to be called.

* Files with names ending in "Z" are compressed, not encrypted. 
[C:/TempleOS/Adam/Dsk/Dsk2a.CPP.Z,91] Copy() or 
rename them with [C:/TempleOS/Adam/Dsk/Dsk2a.CPP.Z,119] Move() to store them
uncompressed.

* TempleOS is open src and every bit of the src code is included in the 
distro.  Use [C:/TempleOS/Adam/Boot/InsBoot.CPP.Z,128]
MakeOSInstallPrtBootLoader() to compile the kernel and compiler.

* TempleOS does not use object files or a linker.  You can link .BIN.Z
modules 
at [C:/TempleOS/Kernel/Hash1a.CPP.Z,733] Load() time, though. 

* The swap rate is high because tasks stay in the queue and poll conditions 
and swap-out voluntarily.  Swaps also occur at 1000 Hz due to the timer 
interrupt.  See [C:/TempleOS/Kernel/Adam1a.HPP.Z,612] JIFFY_FREQ.

* Refresh rate is how often TempleOS updates screen mem.  It is not 
syncronized to the hardware rate, having nothing to do with it.

* No application has a lock on the speaker so apps can interfere with each 
other and TempleOS makes speaker noise during disk access on purpose.

* During boot, TempleOS reads-in all text files in the /TempleOS directory 
tree and collects statistic on them.  It makes a sparse matrix containing the 
frequency each word was followed by each other word.  This makes it able to 
predict the next word while you type.  This feature is called WordStat.

* There are no mem leaks.  TempleOS allocates mem as more items are displayed 
on the screen.  TempleOS allocates mem for code as it is compiled at the cmd 
line.  If you #include a file twice, it allocates more mem for it.  If you 
have a 50,000 line program with each line taking twenty bytes on a machine 
with 1 Gig, you could #include it a thousand times if it had no data or 
graphics and no other use of mem.  Code entered at the cmd line gets
allocated 
and persists.  I don't want to hear any bullshit about leaks unless you 
actually run-out.  If it bothers you, hit <CTRL-ALT-X> and <CTRL-ALT-E>, perio
dically.  Use the pop-up flag on macros in your menu to spawn new tasks, run 
applications and free the applications when they are finished and everything 
will be fine.  Small mem chunks stick to the task when they are freed until
it 
is killed.  The only way to get in trouble involves allocating multiple Meg 
chunks and freeing them.  These can only be reused if the same size gets 
allocated again.  Use [C:/TempleOS/Adam/HeapLog.CPP.Z,121] HeapLog() and
[C:/TempleOS/Adam/HeapLog.CPP.Z,80] HeapLogRep() to see who allocated mem and 
didn't free it.

* The editor periodically takes a snap-shot for UNDO and this looks like a 
memory leak.



* "Linux" is probably a trademark owned by Linus Torvalds.
