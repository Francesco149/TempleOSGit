                              Trivial Solutions


The trivial solution in math is the simple, obvious answer.  The fable that 
NASA spent millions on a space pen while Russia used a pencil is another 
example.  TempleOS uses many [C:/TempleOS/Doc/Strategy.TXT.Z,1] trivial
solutions.

About Me:
I was a National Merit Scholar with a 1440 SAT at Arizona State University.  
Here are my ASU Transcripts.  I have a bachelor's in Computer System 
Engineering from ASU, basically, embedded systems, and a master's in 
Electrical Engineering from ASU, control systems.  I worked as a software, 
hardware and mechanical engineer at Ticketmaster from 1990-1996.  I designed
a 
3 axis stepper-motor-driven milling machine 1996-1997 with a CAD/CAM package 
for a company I started called Home Automation and Robotic Equipment.  I 
worked for a company named Xytec Corp. 1997-1999.  We made FPGA-based image 
processing equipment.  I wrote SimStructure from 2000-2001 for H.A.R.E.  I 
worked as head software/electrical engineer for a company called Graphic 
Technologies, 2001-2002, making replacement chips for toner printer
cartridges 
so they could be refilled.
