Uncomment [C:/TempleOS/Accts/TS/TAD/Adam3cSnd.CPP,1] #include "HDAudio" in
your /HOME/Adam3cSnd.CPP.Z file to install a 
driver for HD Audio.  Cfgure it with [C:/TempleOS/Adam/Snd/HDCfg.CPP.Z,1] and
add 
the file created, HOME/HDAudioCfg.CPP.Z, to your start-up scripts.  **Comment
it 
out everything if you get no snd -- the PC Speaker should still work.**
 
If you don't have HDAudio, you'll have to live with the PC Speaker.  You
might 
write a driver for your snd card following the HDAudio template.

See [C:/TempleOS/Demo/Snd/PolyPhonic.CPP.Z,1],

[C:/TempleOS/Adam/Snd/HDAudio.CPP.Z,376] HDFillBuf() for 
using HD Audio.  The buffers are managed by
[C:/TempleOS/Adam/Snd/HDAudio.CPP.Z,411] HDAudioTask().
