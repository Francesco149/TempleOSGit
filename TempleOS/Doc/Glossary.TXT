+] Task/Process/Thread
  There is no distinction between "task", "process" or "thread."  The Fs
  segment register is kept pointing to the current task's
  [C:/TempleOS/Kernel/Adam1a.HPP.Z,3008] CTask.  There is only one window per
  task.

+] Adam Task
  This is Adam, as in Adam and Eve, the parent of all tasks.  This task is
  created at start-up and appears in the small window at the top beneath the
  user windows.  On it's heap are all memory objects which are system wide. 
  When created, it runs the file [C:/TempleOS/Kernel/Adam1.CPP.Z,1]  Normally,
  Adam1.CPP.Z ends by #include [C:/TempleOS/Adam/Adam2.CPP.Z,1] where the
  remainder of the operating system is "#included".  When start-up is finished,
  the adam task enters a server mode where it accepts requests from other
  tasks.  The [C:/TempleOS/Kernel/TaskCmd.CPP.Z,286] Adam("") routine will
  cause the adam task to compile and run text src code.  "#include" statements
  can be sent to the [C:/TempleOS/Kernel/TaskCmd.CPP.Z,286] Adam("") routine,
  creating system-wide code and data which don't disappear when any particular
  task ends.  (The Adam task is immortal.)

+] Seth Task
  This is Seth, as in Adam and Eve's child.  Each CPU core has a special task
  which is immortal and which is special.  The Adam task on CPU#0 is also it's
  Seth task.

+] Code and Data Heaps
  TempleOS uses the asm CALL instruction exclusively and it's limited to
  calling routines +/-2 Gig from the current code location.  To prevent
  out-of-range issues, I decided to separate code and data, placing all code
  within the lowest 2 Gig of memory.  The compiler and
  [C:/TempleOS/Kernel/Hash1a.CPP.Z,733] Load()er allocate memory from the code
  heap to store code and glbl vars, unless the compiler option
  [C:/TempleOS/Kernel/Adam1a.HPP.Z,1587] OPTf_GLBLS_ON_DATA_HEAP is used.  When
  programs call [C:/TempleOS/Kernel/Memory.CPP.Z,956] MAlloc() is comes from
  the data heap, which in not limited in size, except by how much physical RAM
  memory you have.  You can allocate from any heap you like, or even make
  independent heaps.

+] Parent/Child Task
  Often a task will [C:/TempleOS/Kernel/Task1a.CPP.Z,224] Spawn() or
  [C:/TempleOS/Adam/Doc/DocPopUp.CPP.Z,376] PopUp() a task as a helper.  The
  helper is known as a Child Task, though you can Spawn a task and assign it a
  different parent... like Adam.  Links are kept as to who spawned what so that
  when one task is [C:/TempleOS/Kernel/Task1a.CPP.Z,28] Kill()ed the helper
  tasks disappear, too.  You can get a report on current system tasks with
  [C:/TempleOS/Adam/Utils2a.CPP.Z,429] TaskRep().  There is just one possible
  window per task, so child tasks are needed.

+] Holy C
  The language used by TempleOS is more than C and less than C++.  See
  [C:/TempleOS/Doc/HolyC.TXT.Z,1] Holy C.  It has the default arg feature of
  C++ and uses class in place of struct.  It uses U0,U8,U16,U32,I64 and
  I0,I8,I16,I32,I64 for signed and unsigned integers.  It has a slightly
  different operator precedence.  See [C:/TempleOS/Doc/HolyC.TXT.Z,1]
  OP_precedence  It has the PASCAL-like feature of function calls with no
  parens, but requires an "&" when referring to function addresses.

+] AOT Compile Mode
  I coined this term to refer to conventional AOT compilation mode, but it is
  not the preferred mode for this operating system and is discouraged.  .SP?
  files are compiled to .BI? files, skipping .OBJ files.  After compiling, you
  do a [C:/TempleOS/Kernel/Hash1a.CPP.Z,733] Load() cmd which is available from
  right-clicking on a link (like from [C:/TempleOS/Kernel/Dsk/Dsk1b.CPP.Z,235]
  Dir()).  There is no main() routine.  Instead, statements outside functions
  are automatically executed upon loading.  There is no way to unload except by
  killing the task.  To invoke AOT Compiled Mode, use the
  [C:/TempleOS/Compiler/CmpMain.CPP.Z,372] Cmp() routine or right-click on a
  link.  The Kernel modules and compiler are made in AOT compiled mode and
  stored in Kernel.BIN.C and Compiler.BIN.Z, respectively.

See [C:/TempleOS/Demo/Games/EagleDive.CPP.Z,1] for an example of an AOT
  module.

+] JIT Compile Mode
  In just-in-time mode, the compiler allocates objects, code and data, from
  the heap, incrementally.  This mode is used during cmd line operations.  When
  you #include a file, it is compiled function by function and objects are
  placed all over in mem.  The [C:/TempleOS/Compiler/CmpMain.CPP.Z,577]
  ExeFile() routine is the same as #include but can be placed in programs. 
  [C:/TempleOS/Compiler/CmpMain.CPP.Z,530] ExePutS() routine will compile and
  run a string.

+] Compiler Intermediate Code
  The compiler generates instructions one step before making actual
  assembly(machine) language instructions.  This code is reverse polish in
  nature and can be viewed with [C:/TempleOS/Compiler/Directives.CPP.Z,21]
  PTrace() or [C:/TempleOS/Compiler/Directives.CPP.Z,26] OTrace().  The
  compiler does not "interpret" code, except in the process of optimization. 
  The assembly language can be viewed when it is compiled with the
  [C:/TempleOS/Compiler/Directives.CPP.Z,38] CTrace() routine, or afterward
  with [C:/TempleOS/Compiler/Unassembler.CPP.Z,866] U().

+] Partition/Drive
  There is no distinction between "partition" or "drive."  They are specified
  with a single letter from 'A'-'Z'.

':' is the boot drive.

For commands taking a drive letter as an argument, 0 is the current drive.

+] files_find_mask
  [C:/TempleOS/Kernel/Dsk/DskStr.CPP.Z,40] FilesFindMatch().  An optional
  directory plus a list of file name masks, as in /TempleOS/Demo/*.TXT.Z;*.CPP.Z

See [C:/TempleOS/Kernel/Adam1a.HPP.Z,3587] FUF_RECURSE and
  [C:/TempleOS/Kernel/Define1a.CPP.Z,42] ST_FILE_UTIL_FLAGS.

Be aware of [C:/TempleOS/Kernel/Adam1a.HPP.Z,2212] FILENAME_MASK_TXT and
  [C:/TempleOS/Kernel/Adam1a.HPP.Z,2211] FILENAME_MASK_SRC.

+] Filename Extention Types
  
*.???.Z
  These files are automatically compressed or uncompresses files when read or
  written.
*.???.C
  Contiguous files--NOT compressed.
*.TXT.Z;*.TXT;*.LOG.Z;*.LOG
  Text Files
*.CPP.Z;*.CPP
  Holy C src files.  The default Holy C compiler type is ".CPP.Z".
*.PRJ.Z;*.PRJ
  Holy C src files to be compiled AOT.
*.HPP.Z;*.HPP
  Holy C src header files.
*.MAP.Z;*.MAP
  Compiler "map" files
*.BIN.Z;*.BIN.C;*.BIN
  Binary executable files, created by
  [C:/TempleOS/Compiler/CmpMain.CPP.Z,372] Cmp() and read by
  [C:/TempleOS/Kernel/Hash1a.CPP.Z,733] Load().
*.DAT.Z;*.DAT
  Data files
*.ISO
  CD-ROM image file--ISO9660.
*.AUT.Z;*.AUT
  "AutoFile" Basically a Holy C program who's stdout goes to the input of a
  task when [C:/TempleOS/Kernel/TaskCmd.CPP.Z,396] AutoFile() is called.
*.GRA.Z;*.GRA
  Graphics file

[C:/TempleOS/Kernel/Adam1a.HPP.Z,2211] FILENAME_MASK_SRC
  This #define holds a list of src file extensions.
[C:/TempleOS/Kernel/Adam1a.HPP.Z,2212] FILENAME_MASK_TXT
  This #define holds a list of text file extensions.

+] Naming Convention
  The following are rules I stick to.  If you work on the operating system,
  it'd be good to stick with them for uniformity, but you can do what you like.
   Since there are no "namespaces" and I don't plan to implement name spaces, I
  highly recommend putting a 2-3 character module code prefix on syms. e.g.
  "WS","Doc","Lex"

ALL_CAPS
  Assembly Language labels are capitalized with underscores between words. 
  So are #define's.

_ALL_CAPS
  Asm routines which are [C:/TempleOS/Doc/HolyC.TXT.Z,1] Holy C callible
  should have a leading underscore.

MixedCaps
  [C:/TempleOS/Doc/HolyC.TXT.Z,1] Holy C Functions and class names are
  MixedCaps.

lower_case
  Local function vars and glbl vars are lower case.  Class member names are
  also lower_case.

_lower_case
  Function args which are outputs (passed as ptrs) have leading underscores. 
  Also, args which have identically named local variable counterparts have
  leading underscores. 

DOCf_????
  Flags bit nums instead of bit values are designated with a lower case "f".

DOCG_????
  Flag groups are designated with "G".

"result" is reserved for local variables that hold the function return val.

* I used C++ like naming.  I place "New", "Del", "Init", "Rst", ect. on the
  end of a function name instead of at the beginning.  "RstMusicSettings"
  should be "MusicSettingsRst".


Fs The CPU FS segment register.  This register points to the current task's 
[C:/TempleOS/Kernel/Adam1a.HPP.Z,3008] CTask.

Gs The CPU GS segment register.  This register points to the
[C:/TempleOS/Kernel/Adam1a.HPP.Z,3618] CCPU.

Bt,Bts,Btr,Btc,LBts,LBtr,LBtc
  These are bit manipulation functions named after Intel instructions.  They 
stand for "Bit Test", "Bit Test and Set", "Bit Test and Rst" and "Bit Test
and 
Compliment".  An 'L' means locked.

Cli,Sti Turn on or off interrupts.  They are named after the x86
instructions. 
 "Cli" turns off interrupts.

Heap Programs can dynamically request chunks of memory allocated from a
"heap" 
using [C:/TempleOS/Kernel/Memory.CPP.Z,956] MAlloc().  They must
[C:/TempleOS/Kernel/Memory.CPP.Z,950] Free() it when finished.  Ptrs are used
to refer to 
it.  The "heap" is dynamically allocated mem.

Root The base of a binary tree or the head of a queue.  (I don't like the
word 
"head.")

Join When two parts of a program have a common low-level routine, that
routine 
is often labeled SomethingJoin.

user_data Many operating system structures have space set aside for you to 
store values.  You are on your own managing these with multiple applications 
and libraries.
