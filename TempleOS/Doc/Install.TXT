                             Installing TempleOS

Burn a CD with software that supports ISO files.  Then, boot it.  It's a live 
CD, so you can look around with or without installing.

Dual booting with another operating system is the best way to use TempleOS.  
You'll need a partition for TempleOS.  Windows often comes with a restore
disk 
that does not allow repartitioning.  I recommend connecting a spare
additional 
hard drive and using the BIOS to select which drive to boot.

If you boot the CD-ROM and log-in as the "Install" account it will automate 
much of this.

See [C:/TempleOS/Doc/Boot.TXT.Z,1] Boot.TXT for an overview of booting.  See
[C:/TempleOS/Doc/Requirements.TXT.Z,1] Requirements for supported 
hardware.  See [C:/TempleOS/Doc/Upgrade.TXT.Z,1] Upgrading if you are
upgrading.

Two TempleOS partitions are highly recommended, so you can boot to a back-up 
and fix the primary when you work on it.  Odds are, you only need a couple 
gigabytes for your TempleOS partitions.

1)
  [C:/TempleOS/Kernel/Dsk/DskAddDev.CPP.Z,184] Mount() use if the drive is
  partitioned.
    This command mounts a drive making it accessible.  For simplicity, select 
'C' as the first drive letter for your hard drive.  The first partition 
will be 'C', second, 'D', etc.  TempleOS needs 3 numbers to utilize a hard 
drive -- base0, base1, and unit.  When you enter a hexadecimal number, do 
it like in C with a 0x prefix.  If the probe was successful, you can just 
enter the number in the probe box instead of base0.
  
[C:/TempleOS/Adam/Dsk/Dsk2b.CPP.Z,86] PrtDsk('C') use if drive is not
  partitioned

    This will perform a special [C:/TempleOS/Kernel/Dsk/DskAddDev.CPP.Z,184]
    Mount() automatically.

**WARNING:**  This command erases everything on a hard drive.  It
    repartitions 
a whole drive and formats the partitions.  This command should be skipped 
if you already have your hard drive partitioned.


**WARNING:**  This command doesn't play well with other operating systems.  
You'll need to do a [C:/TempleOS/Adam/Boot/InsBoot.CPP.Z,238]
    MasterBootZero() to restore your drive to a state 
where other operating systems can partition it.
  
2) [C:/TempleOS/Kernel/Dsk/Dsk1c.CPP.Z,181] Fmt('D',TRUE,FALSE,PT_FAT32)
  This command formats a partition with FAT32 or the RedSea file system type.
   
Use the drive letter of the partition in place of 'D'.

**WARNING:**  If you are upgrading, be sure not to lose the file,
  /0000Boot/OldM
BR.BIN.C.

3) [C:/TempleOS/Adam/Dsk/Dsk2a.CPP.Z,148] CopyTree("T:/","D:/")
  This command is used to copy files onto a hard drive partition from the 
CD-ROM.  Use the drive letter of the partition in place of 'D'.

4) [C:/TempleOS/Adam/Boot/InsBoot.CPP.Z,128] MakeOSInstallPrtBootLoader('D')
  This command recompiles the source code on a partition and writes to the
  _par
tition's_ boot record.  You'll need to reenter the
  [C:/TempleOS/Kernel/Dsk/DskAddDev.CPP.Z,184] Mount information so it 
can be stored in the kernel.

5) Use Linux's [C:/TempleOS/Doc/Grub.TXT.Z,1] Grub or TempleOS'
[C:/TempleOS/Adam/Boot/InsBoot.CPP.Z,255] InstallMasterBootLoader('D')
  
The [C:/TempleOS/Adam/Boot/InsBoot.CPP.Z,255] InstallMasterBootLoader()
  command places a boot loader on a drive to 
boot partitions.  It saves the old master boot record to /0000Boot/OldMBR.BI
N.C and replaces it.  When you boot, you will have the option of booting the 
old master boot record.  This command can be skipped if you already have a 
boot loader.  Be sure not to lose the copy of the old boot record, like if 
you reformat the partition.

Delete /0000Boot/OldMBR.BIN.C if you want to get a fresh copy of a mbr, like 
if installing from your own custom CD containing it's own /0000Boot/OldMBR.B
IN.C onto a system with a non-TempleOS boot loader.

If you have anti-virus software, it might object to having a different 
master boot record.
