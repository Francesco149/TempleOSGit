A Queue is a bunch of [C:/TempleOS/Kernel/Memory.CPP.Z,956] MAlloc()ed chunks
of mem linked together in a circle 
with one ptr to the next value and another ptr to the last value.  These ptrs 
must be stored in the first locations in the structure.

Be careful when writing multitasking code not to access Queues while in the 
middle of a change.  You might turn-off preemption or interrupts.
