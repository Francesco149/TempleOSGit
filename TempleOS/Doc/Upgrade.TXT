                              Upgrading TempleOS

To upgrade, you generally boot the new TempleOS CD/DVD, install on top of
your 
partition, modify your files and set it to boot your account by executing 
[C:/TempleOS/Adam/Boot/InsBoot.CPP.Z,128] MakeOSInstallPrtBootLoader(). 
Often, your code will have to be modified to 
work with the new version.  See [C:/TempleOS/Doc/ChangeLog.TXT.Z,1]
ChangeLog.  You might have to boot an 
alternate partition or the CD and modify your code until it boots okay.

The INSTALL option when you boot a CD will install on top of an existing 
install if you tell it not to delete the /TempleOS directory.

See the [C:/TempleOS/Doc/Install.TXT.Z,1] Installing documentation.
