[::/J/ACCOUNTS/TAD/FAVOR.MUZ,1] ::/J/ACCOUNTS/TAD/FAVOR.MUZ (my TODO list)

* Made so you don't need [::/J/KERNEL/MISC.CPZ,0] Exit
 for tasks you spawn.  (Pushed &Exit in Spawn()).
*  **WARNING**: Changed DoMenu and RunLine to return -1 on CTRLQ.  Now
clicking 
window close on a LTF task sends CTRLQ.
