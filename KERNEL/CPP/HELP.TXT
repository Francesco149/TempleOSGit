Fundamentals:
     HOPPY command line interface is based on C/C++.
Explore the ".CPP" files to learn which commands are
available and what parameters they take.
A command which takes no parameters may be executed
by typing the name and a semicolon.  Commands with
parameters require placing the parameter in parentheses.

dir("*");	    Will list files in the current directory
dir;		    Uses default of "*"
cd("/HOPPY/APPS");  Will change directories
Directories are referenced with "/" not "\"

CTRL ALT TAB	Switches tasks
CTRL ALT X	Kills current task
WINDOWS KEY	Activates Menu/Help

edit("FILENAME.TXT"); will invoke the editor.
