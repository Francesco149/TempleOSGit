OS PROGRAMMING RULES:
  1) Only change FS,DS,SS with IRQ's off and preserve them
  2) Only do STD with IRQ's off and clear it
  3) When interacting with compiled code, preserve EBP,ESI,EDI,ECX
     You are free to trash EAX,EBX,EDX
Departures from C/C++ which will be maintained:
  1) No conditional compilation (It clutters code)
  2) No fancy pointer arithmetic based on size of objects
  3) No typechecking
  4) Variable parameter counts are accessed with "argc" and "argv[]"
  5) The "?" operator is used similar to "cout".
  6) Function addresses are preceeded by "&"

FILE LOCATIONS
1) All files lie in the /HOPPY directory, to group them
   in case users wish to place Windows files on the same partition
2) /HOPPY/KERNEL is for files included at start-up,
   including common utility commands
3) /HOPPY/UTILS  is for utility files which don't need to be included
   at start-up because they are rarely used
4) /HOPPY/APPS	 is for applications and subdirectories
   are encouraged
