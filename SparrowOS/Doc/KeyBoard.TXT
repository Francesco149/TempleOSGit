                             Keyboard Allocations

See [Char,1] Char for definition of scan codes.

When you are at the cmd line, editing documents, browsing documentation and 
help, entering items in forms or in menu's, the
[C:/SparrowOS/OSMain/Adam1a.HPP.Z,1403] CDoc editor handles keys.  It 
allows you to define your own key handlers in a
[C:/SparrowOS/Accts/TAD/Adam3dKeyPlugIns.CPP.Z,12] MyPutKey() function.  If
you 
choose, you can catch most keys, overriding the default handlers.  See 
[C:/SparrowOS/Adam/Doc/DocEd.CPP.Z,1497] DocPutKey().  The following is an
overview of key allocations.

ALT-keys and ALT-SHIFT-keys

Free for user cfgurations in your
[C:/SparrowOS/Accts/TAD/Adam3dKeyPlugIns.CPP.Z,12] MyPutKey() handler, except
for ALT-BACKSPACE 
(undo).  There are a few examples pre-defined, but you can change them if you 
wish.

ALT-digit keys

Extended ASCII (3 digit decimal number).



CTRL-ALT-keys and CTRL-ALT-SHIFT-keys

Handled at a system level, NOT by the [C:/SparrowOS/OSMain/Adam1a.HPP.Z,1403]
CDoc editor.  I reserve the right to 
allocate these, but in the mean time, you can make your own by assigning 
handlers to the [C:/SparrowOS/OSMain/OSGlbls.CPP.Z,40] fp_ctrl_alt_let_cbs[]
array.  Be aware that they operate in an 
interrupt framework, so they are tricky to use.


CTRL-function key

Auto-completes wordstat words.



CTRL-digit key

Auto-completes dictionary words.


CTRL-SHIFT-function key

Jumps to src code.


CTRL-SHIFT-digit key

Jumps to dictionary definition.


function keys and SHIFT-function keys

I reserve the right to allocate these, but there are some free now.


CTRL-key and CTRL-SHIFT-key

I reserve the right to allocate to these.  There are not many free.



                              Behind the Scenes

The editor mostly stays in a [C:/SparrowOS/OSMain/KbdMouse/Message.CPP.Z,135]
GetKey()/[C:/SparrowOS/OSMain/Display.CPP.Z,180] PutKey() loop.  The putkey
portion is 
where keys are acted-upon.  SparrowOS has a chain of putkey handlers in a 
[Circular Queue,1] Circular Queue with priorities.  The highest priority
handlers can choose to 
terminate handling, otherwise, the keys get sent on down the chain.

[C:/SparrowOS/OSMain/Display.CPP.Z,255] KeyDevAdd() defines a putkey device
with a priority.  "Device" might be a 
misnomer.  Currently, the following are defined:

Priority    Handler
---------- ---------
0x20000000 [C:/SparrowOS/Accts/TAD/Adam3dKeyPlugIns.CPP.Z,12] MyPutKey() user
handler
0x40000000 [C:/SparrowOS/OSMain/Display.CPP.Z,154] AKDInputFilterPutKey() for
[C:/SparrowOS/OSMain/TaskCmd.CPP.Z,349] Auto(),
[C:/SparrowOS/OSMain/TaskCmd.CPP.Z,378] AutoStr(), and
[C:/SparrowOS/OSMain/TaskCmd.CPP.Z,390] AutoFile() 
handling.
0x60000000 [C:/SparrowOS/OSMain/Display.CPP.Z,134] AKDRawDisplayPutKey()
direct to video mem debug output. 
0x80000000 [C:/SparrowOS/Adam/Doc/DocEd.CPP.Z,2200] AKDDocPutKey() standard
document cmds

Since handling individual keys is slow, SparrowOS supports
[C:/SparrowOS/OSMain/Display.CPP.Z,205] PutS() as well.  If 
no puts handler is defined, individual keys are sent.

[C:/SparrowOS/OSMain/Adam1a.HPP.Z,1403] CDoc.user_put_key and
[C:/SparrowOS/OSMain/Adam1a.HPP.Z,1403] CDoc.user_put_s are call back
routines which offer some 
neat tricks.  See [::/SparrowOS/Apps/MusicOrgan/JukeBox.CPP.Z,1]
::/SparrowOS/Apps/MusicOrgan/JukeBox.CPP.Z.  There is a var 
[C:/SparrowOS/OSMain/Adam1a.HPP.Z,1403] CDoc.user_put_data which gets passed
to them.
