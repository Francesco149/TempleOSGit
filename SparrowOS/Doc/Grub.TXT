                          The Grub Master Bootloader

Here are my grub.cfg file entries for my SparrowOS partitions.  I don't have 
the patience to do it correctly and GRUB obfuscates.  Chain loading is just 
the normal way an operating system like Windows boots.  They do drives, 
zero-based, and partitions on drives, one-based.  They call traditional 
partitioning a "msdos" partition and I presume, if there is a new way to 
partition drives, it has a new name.

In addition to a Windows and a Linux partition, I have a Primary SparrowOS 'D'
, Backup SparrowOS 'E' and a Transfer 'I' partition for transferring between 
Windows and SparrowOS.  "hd0" is 1st hard drive, zero-based numbering. 
"msdos1" is partition #1, traditional msdos partitioning.  I keep 'D', 'E', 
and 'I' identical by frequently copying all files and I use 'I' to transfer 
files.  They only need to be a couple Gig in size.  Every time I copy files, 
use [C:/SparrowOS/Adam/Boot/InsBoot.CPP.Z,157] InstallBoot() to
[C:/SparrowOS/Adam/Boot/InsBoot.CPP.Z,141] MakeAll and prepare the partition
[::/SparrowOS/Adam/Boot/BootHD.CPP.Z,1] boot sector for 
chainloading by patching the new block address and size of OSMain.BIN.C.

menuentry "SparrowOS D" {
	insmod chain
	set root=(hd0,msdos1)
	chainloader +1
}

menuentry "SparrowOS E" {
	insmod chain
	set root=(hd0,msdos5)
	chainloader +1
}

menuentry "SparrowOS I" {
	insmod chain
	set root=(hd1,msdos5)
	chainloader +1
}
