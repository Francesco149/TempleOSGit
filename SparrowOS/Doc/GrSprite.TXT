A CSprite, is an ordered list of the [C:/SparrowOS/Adam/Gr/Gr.CPP.Z,2]
following elements, created with <CTRL-R>
.  Normally, they are packed together in a list and the addr of the first is 
passed to routines.

See [::/SparrowOS/Demo/Graphics/SpritePlot.CPP.Z,1]

[::/SparrowOS/Demo/Graphics/SpritePlot3D.CPP.Z,1]

[C:/SparrowOS/Adam/Gr/CSpriteMesh.CPP.Z,872] CSpriteMesh().

Be aware that copying SP, IB, or IS entries with the clipboard results in 
duplicate entries with different nums.  You can manually remove dups by 
editing with <CTRL-T> and setting to the original num.
