WordStat collects statistics from all text files in subdirectories when you 
call [C:/SparrowOS/Adam/WordStat/WSMain.CPP.Z,652] WSInit().  It counts which
words follow which other words with what 
frequency in a big sparse matrix.

It provides auto-complete typing and jump-to-code or 
jump-to-dictionary_definition functionality.

Tip: If you use consistent var names for items of different classes, you'll 
usually be able to autocomplete the member vars.  I always use lx for
[C:/SparrowOS/OSMain/Adam1a.HPP.Z,2108] CLex 
ptrs; doc for [C:/SparrowOS/OSMain/Adam1a.HPP.Z,1492] CDoc ptrs; doc_e or
doc_ce for [C:/SparrowOS/OSMain/Adam1a.HPP.Z,1316] CDocEntry ptrs, etc.

If you have the raw Project Gutenberg dictionary file, you can generate the 
SparrowOS processed dictionary files with the stand-alone program 
[::/SparrowOS/Adam/WordStat/WSDictGen.CPP.Z,1]
::/SparrowOS/Adam/WordStat/WSDictGen.CPP.Z.
