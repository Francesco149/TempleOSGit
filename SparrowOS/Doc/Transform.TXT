[C:/SparrowOS/OSMain/Adam1a.HPP.Z,3515] CDC's have a 4x4 matrix for rotating,
scaling, skewing and shifting in 3 
dimensions.  To make the graphics routines respond to the transformation, you 
must set the [C:/SparrowOS/OSMain/Adam1a.HPP.Z,3480] DCF_TRANSFORMATION flag.

The matrix consists of integers that have been scaled 32 bits
([C:/SparrowOS/Adam/Gr/MathGr.CPP.Z,142] gr_scale).  See 
[::/SparrowOS/Demo/Lectures/FixedPoint.CPP.Z,1]
::/SparrowOS/Demo/Lectures/FixedPoint.CPP.Z to learn why.

See [C:/SparrowOS/Adam/Gr/MathGr.CPP.Z,163] GrRotX(),
[C:/SparrowOS/Adam/Gr/MathGr.CPP.Z,179] GrRotY(),
[C:/SparrowOS/Adam/Gr/MathGr.CPP.Z,195] GrRotZ(),
[C:/SparrowOS/Adam/Gr/MathGr.CPP.Z,211] GrScaleMat(),
[C:/SparrowOS/Adam/Gr/MathGr.CPP.Z,240] GrRotXEqu(),
[C:/SparrowOS/Adam/Gr/MathGr.CPP.Z,260] GrRotYEqu(), 
[C:/SparrowOS/Adam/Gr/MathGr.CPP.Z,280] GrRotZEqu() and
[C:/SparrowOS/Adam/Gr/MathGr.CPP.Z,300] GrScaleMatEqu() to rotate about axes
and scale.  Combine them 
with [C:/SparrowOS/Adam/Gr/MathGr.CPP.Z,220] GrMulMat() and assign them to
the [C:/SparrowOS/OSMain/Adam1a.HPP.Z,3515] CDC.dc with
[C:/SparrowOS/Adam/Gr/MathGr.CPP.Z,308] GrSetRotMat().  See 
[::/SparrowOS/Demo/Graphics/Box.CPP.Z,1] ::/SparrowOS/Demo/Graphics/Box.CPP.Z.

You can rotate single points using [C:/SparrowOS/Adam/Gr/MathGr.CPP.Z,144]
GrRot().

The 4th dimension allows a neat trick where you can place pos shifts 
(translations), into the matrix and [C:/SparrowOS/Adam/Gr/MathGr.CPP.Z,220]
GrMulMat them to combine rotation/shift 
operations.  Normally, you can't combine pos shift operations.  See 
[C:/SparrowOS/Adam/Gr/MathGr.CPP.Z,354] GrSetTranslation() and
[::/SparrowOS/Demo/Graphics/Transform.CPP.Z,1]
::/SparrowOS/Demo/Graphics/Transform.CPP.Z.

Finally, [C:/SparrowOS/OSMain/Adam1a.HPP.Z,3515] CDC's have an x, y and z
which is an additional shift (translation).

The transformation is implemented as a callback on the
[C:/SparrowOS/OSMain/Adam1a.HPP.Z,3515] CDC's transform() 
member.  The default transfrom() callback is
[C:/SparrowOS/Adam/Gr/MathGr.CPP.Z,154] GrTransform().  See 
[::/SparrowOS/Demo/GameStarters/EagleDive.CPP.Z,1]
::/SparrowOS/Demo/GameStarters/EagleDive.CPP.Z or 
[::/SparrowOS/Demo/GameStarters/FPS.CPP.Z,1]
::/SparrowOS/Demo/GameStarters/FPS.CPP.Z to see how to change the transfrom() 
callback for foreshortening.
