"Input Ptr" is the mouse at this point.

[C:/SparrowOS/OSMain/OSGlbls.CPP.Z,72] ipx and
[C:/SparrowOS/OSMain/OSGlbls.CPP.Z,72] ipy can be used to access the x and y
coordinates of the input ptr.  
They are relative to the screen, not window.  These can be used if you don't 
want to use msg passing.  [C:/SparrowOS/OSMain/OSGlbls.CPP.Z,72] ipz is the
wheel.

[C:/SparrowOS/OSMain/OSGlbls.CPP.Z,78] iptx and
[C:/SparrowOS/OSMain/OSGlbls.CPP.Z,79] ipty are the text column and row of
the input ptr.  See 
[::/SparrowOS/Demo/Maze.CPP.Z,1] ::/SparrowOS/Demo/Maze.CPP.Z.

You can make the input ptr snap to a grid by adjusting Fs->snap.
