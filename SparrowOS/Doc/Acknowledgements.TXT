                               Acknowledgements

I am a for profit company, not an academic.  I have never seen a commercial 
product with acknowledgements like an academic paper.  Never-the-less, here 
are references.  (I don't know the original sources on many of these.)

1) The font, [::/SparrowOS/OSMain/Font8x8.CPP.Z,1]
::/SparrowOS/OSMain/Font8x8.CPP.Z, is taken from FreeDOS.

2) [::/SparrowOS/OSMain/Dsk/ATADef.HPP.Z,1]
::/SparrowOS/OSMain/Dsk/ATADef.HPP.Z originally
from Linux.  I later got the spec.

3) The heap algorithm, [::/SparrowOS/OSMain/Memory.CPP.Z,1]
::/SparrowOS/OSMain/Memory.CPP.Z, is adapted from one I 
saw at Ticketmaster when I worked on their VAX operating system.

4) The LZW compression algorithm, [::/SparrowOS/OSMain/Compress.CPP.Z,1]
::/SparrowOS/OSMain/Compress.CPP.Z, came 
from a magazine and I implemented it when I worked for Ticketmaster.

5) The adaptive-step-size-Runge-Kutta algorithm, 
[::/SparrowOS/Adam/MathODE.CPP.Z,1] ::/SparrowOS/Adam/MathODE.CPP.Z, is
adapted from the book, _Numeric Recipies in 
C_.

6) The random number generator is from the book, _Numeric Recipies in C_.

7) The pilgrim game map is from US Geological Survey.  (Screen captured and 
edited with MS Paint and saved as .BMP and imported into SparrowOS and 
converted with a program I wrote.)

8) Tne sheep in AfterEgypt is from http://www.public-domain-photos.com.

9) The FAT32 file system is owned by MicroSoft.

10) A few features were inspired by MATLAB, such as ans in expressions at the 
command-line.  There is a lot of MSDOS , Windows, VAXTMOS (VAX Ticketmaster 
O.S.) and Unix inspiration, too, such as drive letters, command names, etc.

11) I included [::/SparrowOS/Misc/PCIDevices.TXT.Z,1] PCIDevice Lst File.

12) Thanks to whoever wrote this CppHtml.CPP.Z.  I'm a novice on web stuff
and 
you helped me with html.  See [::/SparrowOS/Adam/ToHtml.CPP.Z,1] ToHtml.

13) Yahoo Sitebuilder helped with some html code items.

14) I used MagicISO to burn test CD's to help me understand the ISO9660 file 
system format.  I mostly used the ISO9660 spec.

15) I looked at bootable CD boot sects, but didn't learn anything, finding it 
easier to make my own.

16) I think I got my original PC speaker code from Borland C.

17) I found PS/2 keyboard and mouse code on the net and documentation.  My 
code is very different.  I found VGA register info on the net.

18) Thanks to http://www.osdev.org for a couple tips.

19) God told me to stick with 640x480x16 color and kept me from blindly
making 
child windows like Windows.  Instead, I made one window per task with no
child 
windows.  He also guided my progress, very obviously.

20) I got Webster's Dictionary and The King James Bible from 
Project Gutenberg.

In short, I wrote every one of the 139,466 lines myself, no GPL code, no 
linkage or dependence on other code.  Anyone who says otherwise is being an 
ass.
