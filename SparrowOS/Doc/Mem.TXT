I didn't want to use paged memory mode, but 64-bit mode requires it.  For all 
intents and purposes, virtual mem (paging) is not used.  SparrowOS identity 
maps pages to physical memory.  All cores use the same page table map.  Page 
table entries have a granularity of 2 Meg, except the first 2 Meg.  It does 
not swap to disk.

SparrowOS always uses 32-bit signed relative jump/call instructions.  It is a 
signed +/- value, so if one part of your code calls a function, the function 
must be within 2 Gig distance.  Therefore, SparrowOS keeps all code in the 
lowest 2 Gig memory addresses including what would normally be called "the 
kernel."  This lowest 2 Gig I call the "code heap".

The compiler/assembler only creates position independent code.  In fact, you 
can't create code which is loaded at a fixed, specified location.  The code
is 
position independent by virtue of the fact that absolute addresses get 
patched.

You can create new independent heaps by first allocating mem with 
[C:/SparrowOS/OSMain/Memory.CPP.Z,428] MemBlksUncachedAlloc() or
[C:/SparrowOS/OSMain/Memory.CPP.Z,215] MemBlksNonTaskAlloc(), then calling 
[C:/SparrowOS/OSMain/Memory.CPP.Z,1167] HeapCtrlIndependentInit() and, then,
using [C:/SparrowOS/OSMain/Memory.CPP.Z,956] MAlloc().

Memory allocated by a task will be freed when the task is killed.

Eventually, memory will become fragmented, requiring a reboot.

* Note: There is a break in the data-heap block pool.  This has no effect 
except the obvious effect that fragmentation has on contiguous requests.  I 
can [C:/SparrowOS/OSMain/Memory.CPP.Z,956] MAlloc() an 8 Gig chunk on my 12
Gig machine.

* Note: For systems with less than 2 Gig RAM, the code and data heap block 
pools are the same.  For systems with 2-4 Gig of RAM, the code heap is 1/4 of 
the total.  See [C:/SparrowOS/OSMain/Memory.CPP.Z,1371] HeapsInit().
