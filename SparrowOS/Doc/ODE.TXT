SparrowOS has an advanced algorithm for integrating ordinary differential 
equations suitable for use in video games.  (Not scientific work.)  It also 
has some support for systems of masses and springs, to save you some work.

See [C:/SparrowOS/OSMain/Adam1a.HPP.Z,335] CMathODE and
[C:/SparrowOS/Adam/MathODE.CPP.Z,512] ODEsUpdate for an overview.
See [C:/SparrowOS/Adam/MathODE.CPP.Z,336] ODECallDerivative to see what
support there is for masses and springs.
