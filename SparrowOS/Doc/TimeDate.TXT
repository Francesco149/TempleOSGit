SparrowOS uses a 64-bit value, [C:/SparrowOS/OSMain/Adam1a.HPP.Z,207] CDate,
for date/time.  The upper 32-bits are 
the days since Christ.  The lower 32-bits store time of day divided by 4 
billion which works out to 49710ths of a second.  You can subtract two
[C:/SparrowOS/OSMain/Adam1a.HPP.Z,207] CDate's 
to get a time span.

Use [C:/SparrowOS/OSMain/Adam1a.HPP.Z,494] CDATE_FREQ to convert.
