AutoFiles are used to generate user input to automate operations.  The 
SparrowOS tour is done with an AutoFile.

When an AutoFile runs, a child task is [C:/SparrowOS/OSMain/Task1a.CPP.Z,228]
Spawn()ed which intercepts real user 
input and generates fake input.  AutoFiles are C+ programs run by the child 
who's stdout goes to the parent's input buffer. 
[C:/SparrowOS/OSMain/TaskCmd.CPP.Z,214] Msg() can be included in an A
utoFile to send special keys or mouse cmds to the parent.  While an AutoFile 
is running, the normal input gets diverted to the AutoFile task and can be 
filtered and sent back to the parent task.  Unless you are driving functions 
which prompt for data, you can probably use an #include file in place of an Au
toFile.

Note: [C:/SparrowOS/OSMain/TaskCmd.CPP.Z,354] Auto("") can be used if all you
need is to send ASCII characters.  It 
differs from [C:/SparrowOS/OSMain/TaskCmd.CPP.Z,384] AutoStr().  You'll
probably use [C:/SparrowOS/OSMain/TaskCmd.CPP.Z,354] Auto() a lot and not
[C:/SparrowOS/OSMain/TaskCmd.CPP.Z,384] AutoStr().  
With [C:/SparrowOS/OSMain/TaskCmd.CPP.Z,354] Auto(), for example, you can
place answers to the prompts for recompiling 
the OSMain module during [C:/SparrowOS/Adam/Boot/InsBoot.CPP.Z,165]
InstallBoot().
