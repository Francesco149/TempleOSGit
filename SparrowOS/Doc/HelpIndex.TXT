+] DIRECTORY STRUCTURE
    
/SparrowOS/Accts Each subdirectory is an acct.  When you boot, you can select
    an acct to login to, unless you compile OSMain soas to pick one.  Your acct
    directory is your HOME directory and all your user data should be placed in
    here to ease backing-up your data.  When you Install an application it will
    create a subdirectory of your HOME directory for storage.

/SparrowOS/Apps Applications are placed in subdirectories of /SparrowOS/Apps.
     Applications should have a file called Install.CPP.Z which will install the
    app for the current user acct.  The file, Load.CPP.Z will load the
    application into mem.  The file, Run.CPP.Z, will usually load and execute the
    app.  To add an app to your personal menu, use <CTRL-L>, insert a macro with
    the PopUp option checked and invoke the Run.CPP.Z file.

/SparrowOS/Demo Here you can find lots of sample code to do various things.

/SparrowOS/Doc Here you can find documentation.

/SparrowOS/OSMain The core of the operating system is found here.  Since
    priviledge levels are not used, calling it a "kernel" would be confusing, but
    that's what it is.  It is statically compiled by
    [C:/SparrowOS/Adam/Boot/InsBoot.CPP.Z,165] InstallBoot().  It is loaded by
    the boot loader and must fit in 640K.

/SparrowOS/Compiler The compiler module src code is found here.  The compiler
    is statically compiled to produce a binary file which is loaded at boot.  It
    is also statically compiled by [C:/SparrowOS/Adam/Boot/InsBoot.CPP.Z,165]
    InstallBoot().

/SparrowOS/Adam The non-kernel part of the operating system is found here. 
    It is JIT compiled during boot.

/0000Boot directory and the 0000OSMain.BIN.C file are named so that they are
    first in alphabetical order and, therefore, at a predictable CD/DVD block
    address.  The [::/SparrowOS/Adam/Boot/BootCD.CPP.Z,1] CD/DVD Boot Loader will
    find 0000OSMain.BIN.C at [C:/SparrowOS/Adam/Boot/InsBoot.CPP.Z,30] Block
    #0x16.  The SparrowOS boot loader can be used with http://www.magiciso.com if
    you place 0000OSMain.BIN.C in the right spot.  OldMBR.BIN.C and
    BootMHD2.BIN.C will be found in /0000Boot if you run
    [C:/SparrowOS/Adam/Boot/InsBoot.CPP.Z,291] InstallMasterBoot() to install a
    hard-drive master boot loader.

  +] DOLLAR SIGN CMDS
    
[::/SparrowOS/Doc/Dollar.TXT.Z,1] Dollar Sign Cmds are rich-text cmds.  The
    editor, compiler, assembler and operating system are seamlessly equiped to
    handle SparrowOS rich text.  Cmds like
    [C:/SparrowOS/OSMain/Dsk/Dsk1b.CPP.Z,233] Dir() and
    [C:/SparrowOS/Adam/Grep.CPP.Z,163] Grep() can output links to the cmd line.

  +] CMD PROMPT
    
The SparrowOS cmd line interface is based on C/C++. Explore the ".CPP.Z"
    files.  A cmd which takes no args may be executed by typing the name and a
    semicolon.  Cmds with args require placing the arg in parentheses like a
    function call.

Dir("*");
`Dir("*");`
 will list files in the current directory.

Dir;
`Dir;`
 uses default of "*".

Cd("::/SparrowOS/Apps");
`Cd("::/SparrowOS/Apps");`
 will change directories.

Directories are referenced with "/" not "\".  The Boot drive is referred to
    with "::".  Other drives are referred to by a letter and a colon.  Your user
    acct directory is referred to with "HOME".

If a file is not found in one directory, all it's parents are searched. 

Ed("FILENAME.TXT.Z"); Invokes the editor. See
    [C:/SparrowOS/Adam/Doc/Doc.CPP.Z,44] DOC LINK TYPES.


Some cmds like [C:/SparrowOS/Adam/Grep.CPP.Z,163] Grep() take a
    "find_files_mask".  They begin with the name of a dir tree and end with a
    list of filename masks.  See [C:/SparrowOS/OSMain/Dsk/DskStr.CPP.Z,50]
    FilesFindMatch().

Grep("pattern","/SparrowOS/Demo/*.CPP.Z;*.TXT.Z;");

Be aware of [C:/SparrowOS/OSMain/Adam1a.HPP.Z,2084] TEXT_FILE_MASK and
    [C:/SparrowOS/OSMain/Adam1a.HPP.Z,2083] SRC_FILE_MASK.

  +] BURNING CD-ROMs/DVDs
    
0) Prepare a directory with the files you wish to burn.
1) Use [C:/SparrowOS/Adam/Dsk/DskCDDVD.CPP.Z,375] CDFileCreate() to make an
    ISO image file.
2) Use [C:/SparrowOS/OSMain/Dsk/Dsk1c.CPP.Z,279] CDImageWrite() to burn an
    ISO file onto a CD or DVD.
