'd'
  Make Directory.

'm'
  ChgDsk (Remount removable media).  Do not do this on blank disks.

'f'
  Format drive.

'M'
  Make CD/DVD ISO file.  This creates a file image of the directory the
  cursor 
is on.  The name of the ISO file is [C:/SparrowOS/OSMain/OSGlbls.CPP.Z,30]
  sys_dft_iso_name and can be redefined in 
your start-up scripts.  You may wish to place it on a different drive.

'B'
  Burn CD/DVD ISO file.  This burns a CD/DVD using the image file, 
[C:/SparrowOS/OSMain/OSGlbls.CPP.Z,30] sys_dft_iso_name to the drive the
  cursor is on.


Instructions on Using CD/DVD's
  If you have not recompiled OSMain and defined your CD/DVD drive, exit the 
file mgr and use [C:/SparrowOS/OSMain/Dsk/DskAddDev.CPP.Z,183] Mount to
  define your CD/DVD drive.  Place a CD/DVD in the 
drive and press 'm' when on top of the CD/DVD drive letter to mount the 
drive.  It will call [C:/SparrowOS/OSMain/Dsk/Dsk1a.CPP.Z,367] ChgDsk(), the
  SparrowOS cmd to mount removable media.


Instructions on Burning CD/DVD's
  Create a temporary holding drive in RAM or on disk, copy files into the 
holding drive.  Make an ISO image of the drive by pressing 'M' when on top 
of the holding drive.  Press 'B' when on top of the CD/DVD ROM drive to burn 
the ISO to disk.  If you have not recompiled OSMain and defined your CD/DVD 
drive, exit the file mgr and use
  [C:/SparrowOS/OSMain/Dsk/DskAddDev.CPP.Z,183] Mount.


Making a Bootable CD/DVD
    
This is a quick way to make an ISO.

#define PROD_CDROM_CFG	"b10x20000\nt3 \n\n\n\n\n"
    
    U0 MakeMyISO()
    {
      Fmt('B',TRUE,FALSE);
      CopyTree("::/SparrowOS","B:/SparrowOS");
      //Del("B:/SparrowOS/Adam/WordStat/WSDefs.DAT");
      Auto(PROD_CDROM_CFG);
      InstallBoot('B','T');
      CDFileCreate(,"B:/*","",BOOTCD_BIN_Z);
    }
    
    
    
    
I have the following code in my start-up script.

'E' is my main hard drive SparrowOS partition

'T' is my CD/DVD drive

'Z' is a RAM temporary drive from which I make an ISO image.  You could 
use a hard drive directory instead of RAM. 

#define PROD_CDROM_CFG	"b10x20000\nt3 \n\n\n\n\n"
    U0 BurnProductionCDImage()
    {
      Cd("E:/SparrowOS");
    
      //This enters my cfg
      //for compiling OSMain.
      Auto(PROD_CDROM_CFG);
    
      InstallBoot('E','T');
      Fmt('Z',TRUE,FALSE);
      Drv('Z');
      CopyTree("E:/SparrowOS","/SparrowOS");
      MkDir("/Temp");
      CopyTree("E:/0000Boot","/0000Boot");
      CDFileCreate(sys_dft_iso_name,"Z:/*",NULL,BOOTCD_BIN_Z);
      CDImageWrite('T',
        sys_dft_iso_name);
    }
