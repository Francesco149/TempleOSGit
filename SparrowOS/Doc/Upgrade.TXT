                             Upgrading SparrowOS

To upgrade, you generally boot the new SparrowOS CD/DVD, install on top of 
your partition, modify your files and set it to boot your account by
executing 
[C:/SparrowOS/Adam/Boot/InsBoot.CPP.Z,157] InstallBoot().  Often, your code
will have to be modified to work with the new 
version.  See [::/SparrowOS/Doc/ChangeLog.TXT.Z,1] ChangeLog.  You might have
to boot an alternate partition or the 
CD and modify your code until it boots okay.

The INSTALL option when you boot a CD will install on top of an existing 
install if you tell it not to delete the /SparrowOS directory.

See the [::/SparrowOS/Doc/Install.TXT.Z,1] Installing documentation.
