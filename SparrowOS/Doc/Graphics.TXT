                              Graphics Overview

* See [C:/SparrowOS/Adam/Gr/GrScreen.CPP.Z,752] GrUpdateScreen() and
[C:/SparrowOS/Adam/Gr/GrScreen.CPP.Z,378] GrUpdateWins().  Only tasks on
core0 are allowed to 
have windows.  There is one window per task and no child windows.

* [C:/SparrowOS/OSMain/Adam1a.HPP.Z,3227] CDCs (device contexts) are a data
type for controlling graphics on the 
screen or graphics in mem, not on the screen.  The device context structure 
has pen width and color associated with it, so you use
[C:/SparrowOS/Adam/Gr/GrDC.CPP.Z,23] DCAlias() to create 
your own structure, with its own color and pen width.  Free it with
[C:/SparrowOS/Adam/Gr/GrDC.CPP.Z,76] DCDel() 
when finished.

* [C:/SparrowOS/Adam/Gr/GrScreen.CPP.Z,5] gr_dc is a global var for a bitmap
redrawn each refresh and placed on the 
screen.  You use an alias [C:/SparrowOS/OSMain/Adam1a.HPP.Z,3227] CDC.  You
change the "Fs->draw_it" var to point to 
your "DrawIt()" which gets called each screen refresh.  You draw everything
in 
the window over and over again.  See [::/SparrowOS/Demo/Graphics/Box.CPP.Z,1]
::/SparrowOS/Demo/Graphics/Box.CPP.Z.
 
* gr_dc2 is a bitmap for persistent data on the screen, not needing to be 
redrawn.  You create an alias for this by using
[C:/SparrowOS/Adam/Gr/GrDC.CPP.Z,23] DCAlias() and work with that.  
It's slightly simpler than using the global var
[C:/SparrowOS/Adam/Gr/GrScreen.CPP.Z,5] gr_dc, but it's not as good 
because changes aren't syncronized to the screen update and window borders
are 
not enforced when windows are moved.  See 
[::/SparrowOS/Demo/Graphics/DotNet.CPP.Z,1]
::/SparrowOS/Demo/Graphics/DotNet.CPP.Z.

* Use [C:/SparrowOS/Adam/Gr/GrDC.CPP.Z,42] DCNew() to create a mem bitmap
which can be used to work off-screen and 
which can be [C:/SparrowOS/Adam/Gr/GrBitMap.CPP.Z,76] GrBloted onto the
screen.  If you set brush member of CDC to 
another CDC, all the graphic routines will
[C:/SparrowOS/Adam/Gr/GrBitMap.CPP.Z,76] GrBlot() the brush instead of 
[C:/SparrowOS/Adam/Gr/GrPrimatives.CPP.Z,47] GrPlot().  See
[::/SparrowOS/Demo/Graphics/Blot.CPP.Z,1]
::/SparrowOS/Demo/Graphics/Blot.CPP.Z.

* There are various flavors of line and point plotting routines. 
[C:/SparrowOS/Adam/Gr/GrPrimatives.CPP.Z,437] GrLine() and 
[C:/SparrowOS/Adam/Gr/GrPrimatives.CPP.Z,47] GrPlot() are the simplest.  The
others allow 3 dimensional graphics and 
rotations.

* See [::/SparrowOS/Doc/Transform.TXT.Z,1] ::/SparrowOS/Doc/Transform.TXT.Z
for adding a transformation.

* Set [C:/SparrowOS/OSMain/Adam1a.HPP.Z,3195] DCF_SYMMETRY in the
[C:/SparrowOS/OSMain/Adam1a.HPP.Z,3227] CDC.flags and call
[C:/SparrowOS/Adam/Gr/MathGr.CPP.Z,373] GrSetSymmetry() or 
[C:/SparrowOS/Adam/Gr/MathGr.CPP.Z,395] GrSetSymmetry3().  This will plot a
mirror image in addition to the primary 
image.  Set [C:/SparrowOS/OSMain/Adam1a.HPP.Z,3199] DCF_JUST_MIRROR to plot
just the image, but this required 
[C:/SparrowOS/OSMain/Adam1a.HPP.Z,3195] DCF_SYMMETRY to be set at the same
time.  Note: You can only have one symmetry 
active at a time including in [C:/SparrowOS/Adam/Gr/Gr.CPP.Z,59] CSprites.

* Use the resource editor, <CTRL-R>, to create a sprite that can be plotted 
with [C:/SparrowOS/Adam/Gr/GrSpritePlot.CPP.Z,27] CSpritePlot3().  Use
$IB,"",1$ in a src program to insert the addr of 
sprite #1.  After creating a sprite with <CTRL-R> in your src code, toggle to 
plain text with <CTRL-T> and check its num.  Then, make an assignment to a
ptr 
var with $IB,"",n$ as the value. See 
[::/SparrowOS/Demo/Graphics/SpritePlot.CPP.Z,1]
::/SparrowOS/Demo/Graphics/SpritePlot.CPP.Z and 
[::/SparrowOS/Demo/Graphics/SpritePlot3D.CPP.Z,1]
::/SparrowOS/Demo/Graphics/SpritePlot3D.CPP.Z.)  The origin (zero point) for
a 
sprite is defined by the cursor location when you press <CTRL-R>.  The "x", "y
" and "z" values you pass to [C:/SparrowOS/Adam/Gr/GrSpritePlot.CPP.Z,27]
CSpritePlot3() shift it around.  You can edit a 
sprite by clicking the cursor on it and pressing <CTRL-R> again.

* There is a mechanism built-in for generating motion based on differential 
equations, which allows realistic physics.  You create an
[C:/SparrowOS/OSMain/Adam1a.HPP.Z,254] CMathODE struct with 
[C:/SparrowOS/Adam/MathODE.CPP.Z,42] ODENew(), passing it the num of vars in
the state vect.  For realistic 
physics, you usually have 2 state vars for each dimension (for each mass) 
because motion is governed by f=ma which is a 2nd order equation.  The two 
states are pos and velocity and to solve these you need to supply the 
derivative of pos and velocity.  The derivative of pos is usually simply the 
current velocity and the derivative of velocity is the acceleration (the sum 
of forces on a mass divided by mass).  To help provide meaningful names for 
values in the state vect, you can create an
[C:/SparrowOS/OSMain/Adam1a.HPP.Z,210] COrder2D3 ptr and point it to a 
mass in the state vect.  Six elements in the state vect are required for each 
mass.

* There are several [C:/SparrowOS/OSMain/Adam1a.HPP.Z,2624] raster operations
available.  They go in bits 8-11 of the 
dc->color member var.

* [C:/SparrowOS/OSMain/Adam1a.HPP.Z,2626] ROP_COLLISION is special.  It
counts the num of pixels drawn on 
non-background locations.  Using [C:/SparrowOS/OSMain/Adam1a.HPP.Z,2626]
ROP_COLLISION with vector [C:/SparrowOS/Adam/Gr/Gr.CPP.Z,59] CSprite's is
tricky 
because overlapping pixels from lines in the
[C:/SparrowOS/Adam/Gr/Gr.CPP.Z,59] CSprite register as collisions.  
You can either work with a nonzero count or convert your
[C:/SparrowOS/Adam/Gr/Gr.CPP.Z,59] CSprite to a bitmap 
if your subelements draw on top of each other.  Be sure to set ->bkcolor 
before using [C:/SparrowOS/OSMain/Adam1a.HPP.Z,2626] ROP_COLLISION.  See 
[::/SparrowOS/Demo/Graphics/PixelCollision.CPP.Z,1]
::/SparrowOS/Demo/Graphics/PixelCollision.CPP.Z, 
[::/SparrowOS/Demo/GameStarters/Rocks.CPP.Z,1]
::/SparrowOS/Demo/GameStarters/Rocks.CPP.Z and 
[::/SparrowOS/Apps/Timeout/Timeout.CPP.Z,1]
::/SparrowOS/Apps/Timeout/Timeout.CPP.Z.
 
* The ->dither_probability member of [C:/SparrowOS/OSMain/Adam1a.HPP.Z,3227]
CDC is a U16 used to statistically select 
between two colors.  See [::/SparrowOS/Demo/Graphics/Shading.CPP.Z,1]
::/SparrowOS/Demo/Graphics/Shading.CPP.Z.  It works 
with most graphic routines, but not those with pens.
