There are sym(hash) tables maintained by each task.  When a sym is not found, 
the parent task's sym table is checked.  All process chain back to the Adam 
task.

SparrowOS sym tables are implemented with an array of linked-lists.  A num is 
generated from a string to index into it.  Since multiple strings could 
generate the same num, a linked-list is built.  Usually, newer entries 
overshadow older ones unless otherwise specified, in which case old entries 
are removed.  There are various types of entries.  See
[C:/SparrowOS/OSMain/Adam1a.HPP.Z,578] Hash Entry Types.
