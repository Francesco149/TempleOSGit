A Character is a single byte holding an ASCII code for a letter, num or sym.  
The SparrowOS term is a U8.

ASCII values range from 0 to 127.  Values below 32 are ctrl key's.  So, an 
ASCII #3 is a <CTRL-C>.  SparrowOS uses a few nonstandard values.  In 
SparrowOS ASCII #5 is the cursor location, ASCII 28 is <SHIFT-ESC> and ASCII 
#31 is a <SHIFT-SPACE>.  See [C:/SparrowOS/OSMain/Adam1a.HPP.Z,3365] Char
Definitions.

A Key is typically specified with a scan code.  SparrowOS scan codes contain 
the key value in the lowest U8, and flags in the upper bytes.  See 
[C:/SparrowOS/OSMain/Adam1a.HPP.Z,3400] Scan Code Flags and
[C:/SparrowOS/OSMain/Adam1a.HPP.Z,3434] Scan Codes.

SparrowOS stores scan codes in 8 bytes.
  Byte 0   is the code with left and right keys combined.
  Byte 1-3 are flags
  Byte 4   is the code with left and right distinct.
  Byte 5-7 are flags

Run the program [::/SparrowOS/Demo/MsgLoop.CPP.Z,1]
::/SparrowOS/Demo/MsgLoop.CPP.Z to examine scan code.

A String is a bunch of ASCII characters terminated with a zero.
