A SparrowOS document is a [Circular Queue,1] Circular Queue of cmds and
graphics.  See [C:/SparrowOS/OSMain/Adam1a.HPP.Z,1227] CDocEntry 
for the entry structure.  See [C:/SparrowOS/Adam/Training.CPP.Z,203]
TipOfDay() for a nice example.

There is one document format for the editor/ viewer/ browser/ cmd line.

Each task has a [C:/SparrowOS/OSMain/Adam1a.HPP.Z,1403] CDoc queue.  There is
one [C:/SparrowOS/OSMain/Adam1a.HPP.Z,1403] CDoc for the border, called 
"auxiliary" and one for the main window.  The aux is at Fs->next_doc and the 
main at Fs->last_doc.  When dbl buffering, there are two main's.  See 
[::/SparrowOS/Demo/Spy.CPP.Z,1] ::/SparrowOS/Demo/Spy.CPP.Z.  It is possible
to define multiple aux's.  To 
insert a additional aux, use [C:/SparrowOS/Adam/Doc/DocNew.CPP.Z,752]
DocQueInsRev(doc,Fs->next_doc).
