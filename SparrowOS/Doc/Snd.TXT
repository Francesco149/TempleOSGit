Uncomment [HOME/Adam3cSnd.CPP.Z,1] #include "HDAudio" in your
/HOME/Adam3cSnd.CPP.Z file to install a 
driver for HD Audio.  Cfgure it with [::/SparrowOS/Adam/Snd/HDCfg.CPP.Z,1]
::/SparrowOS/Adam/Snd/HDCfg.CPP.Z and add 
the file created, HOME/HDAudioCfg.CPP.Z, to your start-up scripts.  **Comment
it 
out everything if you get no snd -- the PC Speaker should still work.**
 
If you don't have HDAudio, you'll have to live with the PC Speaker.  You
might 
write a driver for your snd card following the HDAudio template.
