To create a SparrowOS graphic ctrl, you define call-back functions and insert 
a [C:/SparrowOS/OSMain/Adam1a.HPP.Z,2976] CCtrl structure in the
[C:/SparrowOS/OSMain/Adam1a.HPP.Z,3152] CTask queue.  See 
[::/SparrowOS/Demo/Graphics/SliderCtrl.CPP.Z,1]
::/SparrowOS/Demo/Graphics/SliderCtrl.CPP.Z, 
[::/SparrowOS/Demo/Graphics/ScrollBars.CPP.Z,1]
::/SparrowOS/Demo/Graphics/ScrollBars.CPP.Z and
[::/SparrowOS/Adam/WallPaper.CPP.Z,1] TermButtonNew.  There is a 
managed-code ctrl generator, if you press <CTRL-SHIFT-L>.
