/*
This uses DocPutS/DocPrintF because updates
to within a tree while a tree is collapsed get
messed-up if "live"(like using ordinary PrintF/PutS.)
The insert point is confused by hiding of
data in collapsed trees.  Therefore, the window main
Doc is taken off-line by disabling preemption so there
are no screen updates until all data has been inserted.

There is a special Doc function which is also
available to take an Doc off-line.  See [C:/SparrowOS/Adam/Doc/DocRecalc.CPP.Z,1649] DocInsSafe.
For this example, however, I wanted to use DocPrintF
and disabled Preemption myself.
