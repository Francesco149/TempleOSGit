                                  SparrowOS



SparrowOS is an x86_64, multi-tasking, multi-cored, public domain, open 
source, ring-0-only, single-address-map (identity-mapped), non-networked, PC 
operating system for recreational programming.

A troll might ask, "Why not just use DOS?  It was ring-0-only and 
single-address-map."  Actually, they wouldn't because many people would say, 
"Cool idea!  I'm gonna dust-off DOS right now and have some fun!"  DOS is 
16-bit with segmentation, though, which is awful.  SparrowOS is 64-bit, 
non-segmented and multi-cored.  It's like a modern, souped-up, multi-tasking, 
cross between DOS and a Commodore 64.  It has a C64-like shell with a
[::/SparrowOS/Doc/Differences.TXT.Z,1] dialect 
of C/C++ instead of BASIC.  It was written from scratch, and not even ASCII 
was sacred -- it has 8-bit unsigned character source code to support European 
languages, and source code has graphics.

A troll might say, "But, it can crash!"  Don't give me that.  We all used DOS 
for years and loved it.  Computers even had a reset switch!  Just think of
the 
power of ring 0, muhahahaha!  Think of the speed and simplicity of 
ring-0-only and identity-mapping.  It's only
[::/SparrowOS/Accts/TS/Wb2/LineCnt.TXT.Z,1] 139,466 lines of code, including 
the compiler and can change tasks in half a microsecond because it doesn't 
mess with page tables or privilege levels.  Inter-process communication is 
effortless because every task can access every other task's memory.

It's fun having access to everything.  When I was a teenager, I had a book, 
Mapping the Commodore 64, that told what every location in memory did.  I 
liked copying the ROM to RAM and poking around at the ROM BASIC's variables.  
Everybody directly poked the hardware ports.

SparrowOS is simpler than Linux and you can have hours of fun tinkering 
because all memory and ports are accessible.  Memory is identity-mapped at
all 
times, so you can modify any task's memory from any other task.  You can 
access all disk blocks, too.  I had a blast using a C64 disk block editor to 
modify directories to un-delete files, when I was a kid.  Maybe, you want to 
play with a raw-block database, or make your own file system?

I wrote all [::/SparrowOS/Accts/TS/Wb2/LineCnt.TXT.Z,1] 139,466 lines of
SparrowOS over the last 15.5 years, full-time.  
It was called at various times, "Hoppy", "The J Operating System" or "
LoseThos".  Here are my college transcripts.  I've been a professional 
operating system developer since 1990 when I was hired to work on 
Ticketmaster's VAX OS.
