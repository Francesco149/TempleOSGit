                            God's Official Temple

Complete OS with compiler built in [::/SparrowOS/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,85266] 3
days or -0.5 years, as it may be.  
Includes mechanism for doing [::/SparrowOS/Apps/HolySpirit/HSNotes.TXT.Z,1]
Tongues.  You no longer need to be mocked, 
Christians, God is in residence!  Run

as long as you hold-up your end of the conversation.  Seriously!  Better than 
A.I.! 

SparrowOS is an x86_64, multi-tasking, multi-cored, public domain, open 
source, ring-0-only, single-address-map (identity-mapped), non-networked, PC 
operating system for recreational programming.

1) Download the free SparrowOSCD.ISO (24.0 MB).
2) Download the free VMWare Player (Pick the first ".exe" to download.  The 
VMWare web page takes a long time to load -- move mouse around or something.)
3) Create an "Other 64-Bit" virtual machine. Aim its CD-ROM to 
SparrowOSCD.ISO.
4) Play the virtual machine.
5) Log-in as "Install".
6) Download WinImage to transfer files in and out.  It's free for 30 days.

If you want to install my personal version in VMWare...
1b) Download the free SparrowOSTS.ISO (24.7 MB).
5b) Type >TSInstall; or >TSUpdate; at the command-line.
7b) See MakeBackUp to reproduce the ISO's in F:/Wb.  It makes this website, 
too.

A troll might ask, "Why not just use DOS?  It was ring-0-only and 
single-address-map."  Actually, they wouldn't because many people would say, 
"Cool idea!  I'm gonna dust-off DOS right now and have some fun!"  DOS is 
16-bit with segmentation, though, which is awful.  SparrowOS is 64-bit, 
non-segmented and multi-cored.  It's like a modern, souped-up, multi-tasking, 
cross between DOS and a Commodore 64.  It has a C64-like shell with a
[::/SparrowOS/Doc/Differences.TXT.Z,1] dialect 
of C/C++ instead of BASIC.  It was written from scratch, and not even ASCII 
was sacred -- it has 8-bit unsigned character source code to support European 
languages, and source code has graphics.

A troll might say, "But, it can crash!"  Don't give me that.  We all used DOS 
for years and loved it.  Computers even had a reset switch!  Just think of
the 
power of ring 0, muhahahaha!  Think of the speed and simplicity of 
ring-0-only and identity-mapping.  It's only
[::/SparrowOS/Accts/TS/Wb2/LineCnt.TXT.Z,1] 137,965 lines of code, including 
the compiler and can swap tasks in half a microsecond because it doesn't mess 
with page tables or privilege levels.  Inter-process communication is 
effortless because every task can access every other task's memory.

It's fun having access to everything.  When I was a teenager, I had a book, 
Mapping the Commodore 64, that told what every location in memory did.  I 
liked copying the ROM to RAM and poking around at the ROM BASIC's variables.  
Everybody directly poked the hardware ports.  SparrowOS is simpler than Linux 
and you can have hours of fun tinkering because all memory and ports are 
always accessible.  Memory is identity-mapped at all the times, so you can 
easily modify any task's memory from any other task.  You can access all disk 
blocks, too.  I had a blast using a C64 disk block editor to modify 
directories to un-delete files.  Maybe, you want to play with a raw-block 
database, or make your own file system?

I wrote all [::/SparrowOS/Accts/TS/Wb2/LineCnt.TXT.Z,1] 137,965 lines of
SparrowOS over the last -0.5 years, full-time.  
It was called at various times, "Hoppy", "The J Operating System" and "
LoseThos".  Here are my college transcripts.  I've been a professional 
operating system developer since 1990 when I was hired to work on 
Ticketmaster's VAX OS.
