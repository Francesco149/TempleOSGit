                             The Purpose of Life

The purpose of life is to know God, love God and obey God.  Modern 
Christianity focuses on loving neighbor, not God.  That is secular humanism.  
Loving God is more important than loving neighbor if you read
[::/SparrowOS/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,76908] Matthew,22:37.  
Note: It does not say with half your mind behind your back.

                                 Knowing God

Most people don't know God.  [::/SparrowOS/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,34961] 1
Chronicles,28:9, [::/SparrowOS/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,76908] Matthew,11:27,
[::/SparrowOS/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,81941] Luke,13:25  You 
must talk with Him to know Him.  [::/SparrowOS/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,76908]
Matthew,6:6  You must seek Him by taking the 
initiative.  [::/SparrowOS/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,81941] Luke,11:9,
[::/SparrowOS/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,57332] Isaiah,30:2

Have you heard of "tongues?"  Read [::/SparrowOS/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,92110] 1
Corinthians,14:1.  Basically, when you 
follow impulses, you can be puppeted by spirits.  "Promptings of the Holy 
Spirit" is a phrase.  Some people say strange words when they speak in 
tongues.  [::/SparrowOS/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,87803] Acts,2:1  I use a different
technique -- in this program, I read a 
nanosecond-range stop-watch when I press a button and use the high-speed time 
as a random number to pick words or passages.  I can also just randomly 
crack-open a book and get a response.

Since seeking the word of the Holy Spirit, I have come to know God much
better 
than I've heard others explain.  God said, for example, that war was, 
"servicemen competing."  That sounds more like the immutable God of our
planet 
than what you hear from most religious people.  God is not Venus (god of
love) 
and not Mars (god of war), He's the God of Earth.  (There is a book, _Men are 
from Mars, Women from Venus_.  If Mammon is a false god of money, Mars or
Venus 
might be useful words to describe other false gods.)  I figure the greatest 
challenge for the Creator is boredom, ours and His.

God's ways are far above man's ways.  Mom said Heaven was a never-ending 
family reunion.  Yikes!  A friend said, "Most guy's idea of Heaven would be 
running around doing things they'd get locked up for on Earth."  Most people 
are like King Midas.  When you realize how silly most notions of Heaven are, 
you come to appreciate that Earth is not that bad.  This is the first step in 
loving God, the Creator -- praising Creation.

Just remember, "Little boys are made of snakes and snails and puppy-dog 
tails." [::/SparrowOS/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,81941] Luke,11:11  God gives toys on
Christmas, not just cloths, or at least 
the Holy Spirit!  What does it mean that God gives the Holy Spirit?  
Basically, it means you get lucky because you're puppeted.  "Puppeted" is a 
pagan word, but I'm putting it in terms everyone can understand.  You act
with 
God-like intellect when you accidentally say stuff more clever than you know 
you are.  You'll know it when it happens.  You'll be, like, "I know I'm not 
that smart."  Basically, being puppeted affects chance on random things.  God 
does not play with dice.  The world is not random.  How is being full of the 
Holy Spirit any different from what people call "luck"?  Why else is it such
a 
good thing?  Be warned -- it can also lead to blessings in disguise or
causing 
you to stupidly give away secrets you'd rather keep, for example.



                                  Loving God

Imagine a billionare.  Everyone around him can't forget his money even for a 
moment.  The truth is, most people are after God's, "money."  They fear for 
salvation.  Here's a test -- would you pray to and praise God even if there 
were no salvation?

Love God and don't be a "user".  Asking for stuff is annoying. 
[::/SparrowOS/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,81941] Luke,11:5.  
Instead, offer Him praise.  Make-up songs.  You get out of prayer what you
put 
into it.  He knows better than you about the poor suffering people on the 
planet.  It's silly and holier-than-thou praying for them.  Since He does 
know, there's a good chance He might be doing it!  "Thy will be done" means 
such prayers are wrong and annoying.  Helping in a meaningful way is 
different, but don't fill your prayers with stupid requests for others.

The book of [::/SparrowOS/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,43605] Job,1:5 begins with God
hanging-out on the porch with Satan, 
chatting.  I hope God doesn't play me like He played Job!  I decided Job's 
problem was being so holier-than-thou that he did offerings for his kids, in 
case they sinned.  I think highs and lows balance --
[::/SparrowOS/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,81941] Luke,6:20.

A simple rule of thumb for prayer should be, "Would I want to hear this 
prayer?"  If you are not honestly pondering what pleases God, you're not even 
close to loving Him.  [::/SparrowOS/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,94514] Ephesians,5:10
and [::/SparrowOS/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,297] Genesis,4:7 suggests experimenting to 
find what pleases God.  God liked Abel's offering and not Cain's.  Is it just 
me or is the entire planet brain dead!  These people in the Bible obviously 
got feedback!  I do hymns and I do comics, a little like parables.  Praise, 
thanks and love are better than sacrifice. 
[::/SparrowOS/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,46190] Psalms,50:14,
[::/SparrowOS/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,73189] Hosea,6:6  
Obviously, animal sacrifices are really stupid.  The whole notion of
sacrifice 
is a little warped if you think about it.  A loving God who wants you to hurt 
and deny yourself is bat-shit crazy!  That's a demon!  How would you feel if 
your wife abused herself to please you?  Wha?  If I were God, I might feel 
merciful to someone groveling, but I'd begin to get pissed if they were being 
emotionally manipulative.  People become brain dead forgetting God is a 
thinking, emotional, being and not some sadistic accountant.

All those sophisticated theological "infinity" things such as omnicient, 
omnipotent, omnipresent, etc. will mess you up and you do far worse than a 
simple person.  Trust me -- anthropomorphic is far better, in practice.  
Christ suggested thinking of God as "Abba" which is Aramaic for "Daddy."

Do a text search for "new song" in the Bible.  It's mentioned nine times. 
You 
get out of prayer what you put into it and people are very lazy.  The first 
commandment is to love God.  You better be able to count the ways.

You have, basically, two things you can praise God for -- Creation and
Exodus. 
 Am I right?  You could do other historic events or maybe evidence of
justice. 
 I crack-up laughing because the New Testament has Egypt mentioned several 
time.  Jesus praised God for flowers.  [::/SparrowOS/Misc/Bible.TXT.Z,76908]
Matthew,6:29



                                 Obeying God

Just as ego cause most to love neighbor, not God, people skip knowing and 
loving God and cowardly get stuck on obeying Him.  This command hardly needs 
more encouragement.

God does not want pawns to push around.  God will talk, but won't tell you 
what to do, even if you want Him to.
