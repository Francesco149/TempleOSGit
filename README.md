this is an archive of Terry A. Davis' operating systems.

it includes multiple snapshots of HOPPY, J Operating System, LoseThos,
SparrowOS and TempleOS dating all the way back to 2004

newer versions that use compression have been decompressed and Terry's
doc format has been converted to plaintext while trying to retain as much
info as possible. the idea is to have something that's easily browsable and
diff-able in normal editors

when diffing major versions, it's recommended to use ```git diff -M20%```
to correctly detect renamed files with large changes
